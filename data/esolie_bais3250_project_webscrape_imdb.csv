tt0109830,1. Forrest Gump,8.8,1994,2400000.0,2h 22m,PG-13,When I first saw this movie I didn&#39;t appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn&#39;t as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don&#39;t like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there&#39;s no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it or who thinks that don&#39;t like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...
tt0068646,2. The Godfather,9.2,1972,2100000.0,2h 55m,R,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I should probably go to bed. It&#39;s late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it&#39;s so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it&#39;s not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter&#39;s wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone&#39;s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister&#39;s wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; or &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
tt0120737,3. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,8.9,2001,2100000.0,2h 58m,PG-13,"Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn&#39;t seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson&#39;s vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I&#39;m not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn&#39;t mind Arwen&#39;s inflation and I&#39;m actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I&#39;ve read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn&#39;t play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat&#39;s off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who&#39;s intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It&#39;s EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron&#39;s Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What&#39;s wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!"
tt0167260,4. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,9.0,2003,2100000.0,3h 21m,PG-13,"This movie, and trilogy in general, is a cinematic (and literary) masterpiece, and simply refuses to get old. I love this movie so much it&#39;s become a tradition to watch the Lord of the Rings series at least once a year! It&#39;s just as good as Christmas"
tt0167261,5. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,8.8,2002,1900000.0,2h 59m,PG-13,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who&#39;s leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn&#39;t feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm&#39;s Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word &quot;epic&quot; and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what&#39;s going on.10/10"
tt0914798,6. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,7.7,2008,262000.0,1h 34m,PG-13,"I was so excited my theater got The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, from the moment I saw this trailer, I knew I was in for a treat. This movie just looked incredible, even though it&#39;s a touchy subject with the holocaust, it still looked like it was going to be a great story. Everyone always makes a comment about the innocence of childhood, what it was like to just not have reason, to just go with the flow of things before adults tell you what you have to do. So I watched The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas today and this movie seriously is one of the saddest films I have ever seen, but I felt it was very maturely handled. The actors are great and the story is very touching, to watch these two boys from two completely different worlds who come together just to have fun, be boys, not because of the difference of their background.Set during World War II, a story seen through the innocent eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of the commandant at a concentration camp, whose forbidden friendship with a Jewish boy on the other side of the camp fence. The boys have a great friendship talking every day, enjoying the company. But when the father gives Bruno a Nazi propaganda loving tutor, Bruno becomes confused, is his father an evil man or is his friend the evil one? Love his country and do his duty or don&#39;t judge and just stay true to his friend? Bruno must decide all this with some scary consequences ahead of him.The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a fantastic film, though if you see it, I do recommend bringing the tissues. I couldn&#39;t believe the chemistry they had with these two young actors, they worked so well together as these innocent boys who both have no idea what&#39;s going on. Bruno doesn&#39;t know why his friend is behind fences, and his friend doesn&#39;t know why he&#39;s there either. The ending is extremely powerful and the story keeps you interested. I do recommend seeing The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, it&#39;s a treasure from 2008.9/10"
tt0414387,7. Pride & Prejudice,7.8,2005,352000.0,2h 9m,PG,"Back in 1995, the definitive version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was brought out--and everyone I know who saw that one agrees with me that it is simply the best. Much of it is the acting (having Colin Firth as Darcy isn&#39;t bad) but the biggest reason to adore the made for TV version is that it&#39;s long--very, very long. This allows the story to unfold slowly and is never rushed. Unfortunately, every movie version I&#39;ve seen is just too rushed--and it&#39;s hard to shove this wonderful story into a two-hour time slot. So, no matter how good the 2005 movie is (and it&#39;s quite good), it cannot hope to equal the mini-series. It&#39;s a shame, actually, as there&#39;s so much to like about this Keira Knightly version. The music is great, the locations top-notch and the Bennett girls actually look their proper ages! For example, in the 1940 MGM version, the actual ages of the actresses was their mid-20s to almost 40! And, the Bennetts are supposed to be teenagers (there about)! My advice is go ahead and watch this 2005 film--it&#39;s really very lovely. But then do yourself a favor--find the 1995 version. You&#39;ll be thankful, believe me."
tt0332280,8. The Notebook,7.8,2004,654000.0,2h 3m,PG-13,"My wife and I watched this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it whilst acknowledging its manipulative aspects. I do get the bad reviews. We watched it again today while in lockdown due to coronavirus. We are now in our late 70s. For us the subject of the central relationship was very close to home both in the development of the love of the central characters and in the enduring nature of that love in their twilight years. It&#39;s easy to be cynical about a movie such as this but, boy, does it pack a punch when you&#39;ve lived it."
tt0421715,9. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,7.8,2008,721000.0,2h 46m,PG-13,"F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s short story &#39;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&#39; has been transformed into a splendid film by David Fincher. A marvelously made film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the best movies of 2008. The cast is terrific and director David Fincher beautifully puts together the tale of Benjamin&#39;s life. The only large flaw many will find is that the concept of the film&#39;s premise seems too unrealistic.The film tells the life of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). Born as an old man, Benjamin ages backwards; gradually getting younger as those around him age normally. Benjamin is abandoned at birth and picked up at an old-age home. As a child - or rather as a hunched over 80 year old - he meets a girl named Daisy (Cate Blanchett). Together they engage in innocent child games, and through this they develop a special connection. As Benjamin goes off into the world, Daisy continues to grow up, later pursuing her dream of dancing. Benjamin joins a crew and sails round the world, ending up in Russia. Then, after Pearl Harbor, Benjamin joins in the war effort, following battles across the north Pacific and only engaging in one combat situation.Returning to New Orleans, Benjamin has grown taller, lost many of his wrinkles, and grown more hair. The visual effects are spectacular in following Brad Pitt through the various stages of his life. From an old man to a young teen, Benjamin always resembles Pitt. Upon arrival in his childhood home, Benjamin learns that many of the tenants he knew have passed on. This is the tragedy of aging backwards, those you knew continue to age forward as they exit this world while you do the opposite. Benjamin also meets Daisy again, who after many years has become a successful dancer and has blossomed into a beautiful young woman. Long gone is the innocence of childhood, and Daisy has become intimate with many men in New York City. Missing by an inch, she and Benjamin do not initiate a relationship until later in the film.Narrated from the present, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button starts with Daisy&#39;s daughter reading Benjamin&#39;s diary to her mother in a hospital on the cusp of Hurricane Katrina. This allows the narration to occasionally halt for an elderly Daisy to comment on events of her life. A key motif running throughout this film is time. Beginning and ending with sequences about the same clock, David Fincher seems to allude to the notion that things fade, and that we must hold on to the things we love in the time we have with them.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fantastic film. Beautifully created, David Fincher paints an image of the south of the United States in the early 1900s which seems both realistic and fantastical. The film also illustrates war, travel, death, and many of the other events of life. Brad Pitt shows emotional depth as Benjamin, and Cate Blanchett is terrific as Daisy. It is surprising how much we can take away from a 166 minute movie, the audience feels as if they have known Benjamin and Daisy for all of their lives. While some may question the premise of the film, arguing that time is linear and that the plot is therefore incoherent, there can be no arguing that this film does its best to develop human relationships and to establish emotional connections between characters. As Roger Ebert once said, &quot;A film is not about its subject; it&#39;s about how it&#39;s about its subject&quot;, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button certainly handles its subject material splendidly."
tt0281358,10. A Walk to Remember,7.3,2002,227000.0,1h 41m,PG,"This was one of the best films I&#39;ve seen lately. Mandy Moore shone in her role as Jamie Sullivan, although never to the point where she became unbelievable. Her singing was fabulous, but it was clear that this was not a film about her singing - too many pop artists starring in films wind up in films about their pop careers, whether real or inferred.The storyline was VERY good. I can&#39;t say too much without spoiling it for everyone else, but take my word for it. You absolutely must watch this film at some point - make sure you grab plenty of tissues though, because if you don&#39;t get emotional towards the end, you must have a heart of stone.All in all, fantastic."
tt0480249,11. I Am Legend,7.2,2007,849000.0,1h 41m,PG-13,"If I could sum this movie up in one sentence, it would be this: Go Will. Will Smith is the driving force of I Am Legend. His performance as Dr. Robert Neville is impeccable. Living in a deserted NY city, his acting is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but instead of a volleyball, he has mannequins and a faithful German Shepard named Sam. His basement, a retro-fitted, high-tech lab to find a cure for the disease that has turned the population of the entire planet into mutant, zombie-like, hive mind, blood-thirsty monsters, and, for some reason, Robert is immune. His days, spent hunting. His nights, sleeping with a high-powered rifle and hoping that the mutants don&#39;t find him. Keeping the movie flowing are well placed flashbacks that show what happened to Robert&#39;s family and why he is there. The movie falters a bit at the end, maybe at the last 5 minutes, but it doesn&#39;t ruin the plot or acting put forth. Containing wonderful cinematography and CG, I Am Legend is a spectacular film that I will be seeing again! PS - Shout out to my NY National Guardsmen in this film! Great job!"
tt0396171,12. Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,7.5,2006,273000.0,2h 27m,R,"With &quot;The Perfume&quot; it&#39;s like with any blockbuster movie: if the critics praise it, it&#39;s horrible - if the critics hate it, it&#39;s brilliant.I had the chance to watch a preview of &quot;The Perfume&quot; tonight and I was very surprised: this movie is really good! Okay, it can&#39;t actually make you smell all the scents and odours, but the images and the music allow you to experience the atmosphere and the emotions Grenouille is feeling when he takes in the scents of his environment. You couldn&#39;t have done this much better without the use of real scents at theatres.Although much of the story is told by a narrative voice (mostly quotes from the novel), the movie is still thrilling and exciting all the way. It&#39;s a very good adaption of Süskind&#39;s novel, sticking to the original plot concerning the major events, leaving away unnecessary subplots (although it&#39;s a pity that funny &quot;lethal gas&quot;-plot was cut out!) and shortening long passages. The result is well-constructed movie that is worth seeing.The actors, especially Whishaw who plays Grenouille, have done a very good job. Like in the novel, Grenouille is an ambivalent character and you never know whether to love him for his genius talent or to hate him for his cruel murders. Whishaw&#39;s half-crazy, scary gaze made me shiver. Dustin Hoffman as old and unsuccessful parfumeur Baldini was very convincing... I loved the way he talks to Grenouille arrogantly although he recognizes how much more talent the young man has. Baldini is always good for a laugh.The only thing to criticize is that the movie is not as brutal as the novel. I think they wanted to avoid the FSK 16 rating and so didn&#39;t show much violence, which in my opinion would have been necessary if you wanted the movie to have the same shocking impact on the audience as the novel. For example I was really shocked by the end of the novel - in the movie you hardly see what happens.However, it&#39;s really a thrilling story visualized excellently - go to the movies and watch &quot;The Perfume&quot;! You won&#39;t be disappointed."
tt0458352,13. The Devil Wears Prada,6.9,2006,499000.0,1h 49m,PG-13,"We in the United States like to believe that we reside in a country without royalty and nobility. The only people who think that there is true egalitarianism have never worked in the Entertainment and Media Industries. There is an aristocratic elite, no question, and it is not exactly made up of politicians (although there are some). It is largely composed of those who control media, particularly in television, film, radio, music, fashion, and print. They control what get&#39;s seen and what doesn&#39;t. When these people put on huge events that involve the press, cameras, and limousines, the public comes out to pay unquestioned homage to these elites, often on the sideline behind a barricade. With cameras flashing, these people are treated like the royalty of the 17th and 18th centuries. &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; examines what is like to be in the inner circle of one of these elites.In addition to the public&#39;s clamoring to glimpse these powerful elites, another segment of the population desires to become one of these people by trying to &quot;break into&quot; the media business. Since there are many more people who dream of being in these circles than there are spots available, this gives enormous power to those already on the inside, particularly those who have sway to either make or break an up-and-coming career. &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; chronicles an aspiring journalist who lands a dream job that, she is told, &quot;thousands would kill for&quot;: being the personal assistant to the editor of one of the largest fashion magazines, Runway, whose editor-in-chief makes Bill Gates seem like a softy. The character, Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep in a tour-de-force Oscar-nominated performance) is in fact modeled after real-life Vogue Magazine editor Anna Wintour whose chilling detachment from those around her, her ability to make or break fashion careers, and her cut-throat demands on her staff have become legendary throughout the fashion world.In the film, the corporation that is &quot;Runway&quot; is no democracy. It is feudalism, with Mirander the absolute queen ruling over her dominion of serfs who constantly scatter about trying to please her. The central character, Andy Sachs, is plunged into this Madison Avenue purgatory without knowing the rules of the game. A journalism-major from Northwestern, Andy knows next to nothing about the fashion world, but it&#39;s not just the fashion world--it&#39;s the world of the elite in New York. Since everyone wants to gain favor from the higher-ups in order to step up the ladder, there&#39;s often over-the-top deference to those in elite positions. I half-expected her female assistants to curtsy when Mirander entered the office. Mirander knows perfectly-well her status and she uses it, often flaunts it, to her advantage. Her staff run around like castle servants anticipating the arrival of the Lady of the Manor.Streep is magnificent as her voice never reaches past mezzo-piano. When one of her staff has transgressed, or simply cannot fulfill her expectation (I doubt Superman could hold a job there), in the softest tone possible she expresses her disappointment. And yet, the anticipation of her negative reaction is what makes for moments of anti-gravitational intensity. Of course, she never compliments anyone when they&#39;ve done well. Excellent performance is taken for granted in this kingdom. I&#39;ve never found the raging tyrant frightening. Rather, it is the even-tempered soft-spoken empress with absolute power who sends anyone who to displeases her to the block with a disinterested wave of the figure that is the most terrifying.At one point in the film, Andy chuckles when Miranda fusses over some seemingly identical-looking belts which of course spawns a lecture about how Andy&#39;s current wardrobe was in fact created by the fashion elite. This does point to another side of the fashion facade which I think may be the point of the film. If you take away the cameras, the celebrities, the allure, the models posing in museums wearing the latest by Christian Dior, at the end of the day all this is about is just jackets, belts, purses, skirts, dresses, and pants. I think one of the characters says as much. These clothes may look wonderful, even stunning, but that&#39;s all they are. They are lifeless pieces of fabric cut in a certain way to make the wearer look appealing but that&#39;s all it is. The fashion industry of course needs to perpetuate the idea that clothing is much more than clothing: that beautiful fashions will create fairy-tale existences for the purchasers. They are meant to represent a life of luxury and splendor and the purchase of these articles will bring you closer to that reality. When it doesn&#39;t, you need to buy more of these clothes. And you need to read Runway (aka Vogue) to tell you what you should buy. Of course, the only ones who actually have these fairy tale existences are the ones providing the clothes. Most of the people buying these fashions are still behind the barricade. Is there an irony here?"
tt0253474,14. The Pianist,8.5,2002,967000.0,2h 30m,R,"Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way &quot;The Pianst&quot; did. The last movie that did that was &quot;Casino&quot;. I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I&#39;ll start watching and I&#39;ll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn&#39;t stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot;, I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn&#39;t enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody&#39;s performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you&#39;re the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn&#39;t have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I&#39;m sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn&#39;t the 1930&#39;s or 40&#39;s, and we are in America. But it&#39;s still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It&#39;s a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I&#39;m not talking about Adrien Brody&#39;s character. You&#39;ll see what I mean.10/10"
tt0398808,15. Bridge to Terabithia,7.2,2007,182000.0,1h 36m,PG,"When I sat down to watch Bridge to Terabithia, I did not know quite what to expect. From what I had seen in the trailers, I thought the movie would be about two kids that end up in some magical world, similar to the Chronicles of Narnia (clearly, I did not read the book). Needless to say that I was surprised when actually seeing the movie. I shall not spoil the story for those who have yet to see the movie, but I will say that, in my opinion, this movie is for a more mature audience than one would think. Rather than being a fairytale for youngsters, the movie actually gives the viewer an inside look in a young boy&#39;s life and all the troubles he faces, concerning school, family and friends. The setting overall was a lot darker than expected as well. I can be short about the acting. The child-stars that play the lead roles did a great job and really brought the characters to life. On this subject I must give some credit to the director as well, as it is very difficult to work with children and to get them to play the part exactly the way you want them too. One final aspect of the movie that deserves mentioning is the fact that it does not lean on special effects. Although there is a fair amount of nice CGI present in the film, the story dominates. Which in my opinion, is a lot better than the other way around. Overall, I found the movie very enjoyable, but I would advise parents of young children to find out more about the movie, before deciding on whether or not you&#39;ll let your kids watch it."
tt0431308,16. P.S. I Love You,7.0,2007,222000.0,2h 6m,PG-13,"I saw this movie on a girls-night-out to the movies, and we chose it on the basis of the previews, which had billed it as a romantic comedy. Wow, were they ever wrong! The basic plot is this: Woman loses husband far too early and tragically. Woman grieves for husband, hard. Husband, through a plan pre-arranged before his death, sends woman letters at set intervals, each one causing a fresh stream of tears to fall.The acting was great. Hillary Swank was particularly good in her role, and let us see her vulnerability and conflicting emotions. The supporting cast was all excellent, and ladies, there is more than enough male eye candy in this movie to go around.But - and I strongly warn all of you considering this as a light comedy or a date movie - it&#39;s sad. Very very sad. Even the happy parts are sad. If you go see this, wear waterproof mascara and bring lots of tissues. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you."
tt1078588,17. My Sister's Keeper,7.3,2009,101000.0,1h 49m,PG-13,"80/100. This was so much more interesting than I was expecting. It tackles several issues and does so with finesse and without the over the top melodrama movies of this type so often have. It&#39;s touching, thought provoking and it is certainly not predictable. Nick Cassavettes deserves a lot of credit for creating a film that faces the issues without getting too maudlin and does so with sensitivity and objectiveness. The performances are good from everyone. The casting of Cameron Diaz isn&#39;t perhaps the best, but I admire the effort she put into the role. She did very well. The character development is outstanding, you get to know each character and you understand each of their perspectives. Joan Cusack is particularly affecting in an offbeat role for her. Good score, the subtle cinematography is effective."
tt0382625,18. The Da Vinci Code,6.6,2006,472000.0,2h 29m,PG-13,"I&#39;ve read the book, and the movie&#39;s not so bad. Obviously there are many things I&#39;d do different, but in the end it&#39;s 2,5 hours of good entertainment, and isn&#39;t that what the ratings are all about? Personally I think Tom Hanks wasn&#39;t passionate enough for Robert Langdon. That&#39;s why it&#39;s not a 9 for me.A lot of people are too harsh on this one. Mostly because they know the book and have very high expectations. I have to see my first book-to-film where the film is better.Also, you&#39;re not going to hell for watching this movie or reading the book. It&#39;s based on a novel, which is based on a few loose theories, but in the end all it wants to do is to entertain. And that is exactly what both the book and the movie did for me."
tt0808151,19. Angels & Demons,6.7,2009,318000.0,2h 18m,PG-13,"Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown&#39;s symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels &amp; Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter&#39;s more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it&#39;s not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter&#39;s Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets, the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou&#39;s character then having a lot more stake in the film, Zurer&#39;s scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti-matter. In the book she&#39;s the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she&#39;s neither love interest, nor his intellectual equal.Ewan McGregor on the other hand, chews up each scene he&#39;s in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there&#39;s more than meets the eye. There&#39;s no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor&#39;s performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks.The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always, and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work. While reading the book some years ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it&#39;s easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that&#39;s what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn&#39;t allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some &quot;discussion time&quot; over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it&#39;s like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.Catholic reviewers have called Angels &amp; Demons harmless, because I guess it didn&#39;t dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter&#39;s Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that&#39;s almost free.Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven&#39;t, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown&#39;s novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid. Satisfying pop-corn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular."
tt3062096,20. Inferno,6.2,2016,196000.0,2h 1m,PG-13,"I enjoyed the Inferno film for the most part as I&#39;m very fond of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. One of the main reasons that I like these books so much is because they provide such a wealth of background historical information so they&#39;re a prefect blend of education and entertainment.While it was obviously impractical to include an involved literary discussion of Dante&#39;s Inferno in the film, it&#39;s a shame that it was barely touched on at all as to me, it was one of the most interesting aspects of the entire story. Like many, I was also surprised and disappointed by the changed ending. The book&#39;s solution was challenging but elegant; the filmclunky and predictable. Pity."
tt0822832,21. Marley & Me,7.0,2008,172000.0,1h 55m,PG,"When I first saw the previews for Marley and Me, I thought, ugh, another desperate attempt by Jennifer Aniston to resuscitate her career. I used to be a huge Aniston fan back in the &quot;Friends&quot; days, but it&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve seen any of her movies. And as for Owen Wilson, he always seemed like a goof who rode on the wave of his older brother&#39;s success. This movie proved me wrong on both counts.Marley and Me is about a dog, definitely, but it&#39;s just as much about a man (John Grogan, played by Wilson), his wife (Jenny, played by Aniston), and his growing family. The film follows John from his wedding night to the peak of his journalism career a dozen years later, years that are chronicled in his weekly columns for a Florida newspaper. Marley, the lovable but horribly destructive yellow lab, enters his life as a puppy, in an attempt to prepare him and his wife for future children. The dog, as expected, tears apart the house, makes wild escapes, humps the dog trainer, and lovably terrorizes other people. But the film effectively intersperses those episodes with tender, sincere moments of human/dog bonding. Marley is there to comfort Jenny when her husband cannot, adjusts to the children as they grow older, and intrudes on the family&#39;s most private moments. He is a constant, and at times, annoying presence, but Marley underscores the emotional tone of the film without dominating it.Similarly, both Wilson and Aniston deliver understated performances that convey the ups-and-downs of any marriage. While it is the bond between John and Marley that the film explores most deeply, Jenny provides the link between dog, family, and children. In the end, she realizes what Marley has become, and what he has always been, to the two of them. The film&#39;s overall tone - light, humorous, but at times very real - builds up to an ending that is surprisingly moving. Marley and Me is a tender-hearted, easy-going film that will appeal to any dog-lover. But it will also, I think, appeal to anyone who can look back on his or her life and trace a common thread through each passing year. A beloved pet, like Marley, has that unique capability. I wish I could thank my own dog for that. But, as one of the children in the movie tearfully says, I&#39;m sure he already knows."
tt0343818,"22. I, Robot",7.1,2004,596000.0,1h 55m,PG-13,"The film shares the same name as Asimov&#39;s novel, but with some adaptations. But in general, it doesn&#39;t break the three laws. This kind of science fiction film, which integrates human nature and ethics of science and technology, triggers our deep reflection. Human beings and robots have advantages and disadvantages, no matter when, in front of any biological species, we always have the freedom to choose."
tt0110148,23. Interview with the Vampire,7.5,1994,362000.0,2h 3m,R,"Based on the Anne Rice&#39;s novel and with a screenplay adapted by herself, this film tells the story of Lestat and Louis, two vampires with over three hundred years. Directed by Neil Jordan, has the participation of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst (as a child). It received two nominations for the Oscar (Best Art Direction, Best Original Score).This is the film adaptation of one of the greatest horror novels of this American author, and is even more appealing when we realize that she actively collaborated with the production, signing the adaptation of the script. Indeed, it&#39;s a great script, faithful to the novel and original story. And for me, this movie has another good note: fully escaping the recent &quot;sex symbol vampire&quot; cliché, fueled by movies like &quot;Twilight&quot;, this film depicts vampires as they really should be: monsters with some psychological depth.The actors are excellent in their roles. The highlight goes obviously to Pitt and Cruise, who were not only perfectly able to give charisma to the characters but also not ignore the importance of the psychological characteristics. Pitt took it to the extreme in his character, torn between the love of his own humanity and the overwhelming desire for blood he feels. The way both actors share the scene is irresistible, such as how Cruise transforms his character in &quot;evil genius&quot; of his friend.The film contains several very intense scenes with moments that can hurt some sensibilities. Nevertheless, its not a very bloody movie. The atmosphere is dark, sinister, something largely enhanced by the cinematography, dark and misty, and the soundtrack, worthy of a good horror movie (something that this film is definitely not). The special, visual and sound effects are good, such as the characterization and makeup. The costumes are exceptional, portraying accurately the clothes of the several historical periods portrayed throughout the film."
tt0107290,24. Jurassic Park,8.2,1993,1100000.0,2h 7m,PG-13,"This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. 
Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. 
The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (&quot;I threw up.&quot; &quot;Well that&#39;s ok! That happens sometimes&quot;-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). 
Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. 
As a classic worldwide, it&#39;s no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow."
tt0108052,25. Schindler's List,9.0,1993,1500000.0,3h 15m,R,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won&#39;t go along with the cruelty of society. I&#39;m sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you&#39;ll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn&#39;t be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he&#39;ll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler&#39;s last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - &quot;Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.&quot;"
tt1010048,26. Slumdog Millionaire,8.0,2008,895000.0,,R,"There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year&#39;s &#39;Juno.&#39; It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People&#39;s Choice Award. Boyle, who is somewhat like a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A. R. Rahman, with contributions from M. I. A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.The film begins as Jamal (Skins&#39; Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India&#39;s version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal&#39;s boyhood and explain how he got to the show.At the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal&#39;s mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.Like &#39;Juno,&#39; Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedic drama, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal&#39;s story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal&#39;s hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn&#39;t his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be a better picture this year."
tt0243155,27. Bridget Jones's Diary,6.8,2001,278000.0,1h 37m,R,"Being a long time fan of the BJD books (three years and counting), I had nothing but high hopes for the movie version. I was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview last night, and I was not disappointed. The movie, like the book, has the most hilarious lines and moments, and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn&#39;t imagine anyone else in that part.  Renee Zellweger IS Bridget, there is just no arguing it. No other actress could have pulled off what Renee did in this movie. Hugh Grant makes for an excellent Daniel, who is completely two faced and has a smarmy sort of charm that makes you want him just as badly as Bridget does. Colin Firth is a superb Mark Darcy, but that was a given because the character was practically written with him in mind - as all avid BJD readers know, Mark Darcy&#39;s character is a play on the Mr. Darcy Firth portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.Some of the more hardcore fans of the book may be disappointed with all the missing jokes and scenes, but to film the entire book would have left us with a 10 hour movie. The writers did an excellent job distilling the essence of the novel, and the finished product has all the charm and wit of the original. The audience, many of whom I&#39;m sure have never read the book (and many of whom, surprisingly, were male), laughed nonstop throughout the film, and everyone seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. As for those of us who have read it, I do believe that this is one of those rare book-to-movie jobs that was really spot-on, and everything that was noticeably changed in the process only makes the movie better.  So go see it, it&#39;s hands-down one of the best movies of 2001 so far."
tt0120689,28. The Green Mile,8.6,1999,1500000.0,3h 9m,R,"&quot;The Green Mile&quot; is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King&#39;s &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with &quot;The Green Mile&quot;.  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can&#39;t understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn&#39;t feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. &quot;The Green Mile&quot; will haunt you."
tt0066921,29. A Clockwork Orange,8.2,1971,911000.0,2h 16m,R,"Few films are as sensational or infamous as Stanley Kubrick&#39;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. It&#39;s impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent &quot;reformation&quot; by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever. While the film&#39;s depictions of violence and sex are what it&#39;s most known for, ACO works on far deeper levels. The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government&#39;s attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can&#39;t be denied. Equally excellent to the film&#39;s content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick&#39;s perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick&#39;s use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist&#39;s behavior and the government&#39;s policies. A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It&#39;s a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think. Real horrorshow all around, Oh my brothers."
tt0102926,30. The Silence of the Lambs,8.6,1991,1600000.0,1h 58m,R,"The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn&#39;t bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it&#39;s absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal&quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he&#39;s also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster&#39;s Clarice Starling asking for Lecter&#39;s help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He&#39;s a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film&#39;s ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.Best watched with a nice Chianti...P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?"
tt0489099,31. Jumper,6.1,2008,331000.0,1h 28m,PG-13,"What would happen if you could teleport ANYWHERE in the world in the blink of an eye? Thats the question explored in Jumper, a film thats as fast and action packed as it is hollow and underdeveloped.The films theme of individuals who can vanish and reappear anywhere they choose is a great idea but its execution is a little weak in Jumper. Why? The blame rest squarely on the films instance on being the start of a series. Instead of taking time to develop anything in the movie, Jumper just whizzes by at an incredible speed, setting up characters, ideas and plot points without expanding or resolving or developing them. The whole thing is made to kick start a franchise of films where the story would be explained in more detail, but come on man, when you pay to see a film, you expect to see a clearly defined beginning, a middle and a satisfying end- something that Jumper isn&#39;t too concerned with.Another problem that ties in with the films lack of depth, are the actors. While Hayden Christensen is as bland as usual, the cast (including the usually electrifying Sam Jackson) just sleep walk their way through the superficial script. Only Jamie Bell gives it some effort- his cynical Irish jumper would have made a much better lead character than Anakin.However, while the film is pretty shallow there are some glimmers of goodness. The action sequences are fun, fast and frequent, the visual effects are cool and there&#39;s never a dull moment due to the films super fast pace.It might sound like Im being too harsh on the film but its hard not to be when the movies concept is so great and the end product is as underdeveloped as this. If the film had a more detailed, more fleshed out, more self contained story, Jumper would have been a classic."
tt0070047,32. The Exorcist,8.1,1973,477000.0,2h 2m,R,"Stunning visuals, effects and overall horror for 1973. The characters are very strongly portrayed and the feeling of hopelessness is ever-present throughout the movie. Even though some scenes are outright shocking and provocative, there is also a strong element of the uncanny present. This is a very haunting movie that still shocks, amazes and intrigues after all these years."
tt0111161,33. The Shawshank Redemption,9.3,1994,3000000.0,2h 22m,R,"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn&#39;t said before? Not much, it&#39;s the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can&#39;t remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you&#39;ve seen it, you don&#39;t forget.The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn&#39;t mine, but I get it. If you haven&#39;t seen it, or haven&#39;t seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it&#39;s amazing. 10/10."
tt0081505,34. The Shining,8.4,1980,1200000.0,2h 26m,R,"Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson&#39;s descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense &quot;writing&quot;... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script."
tt0775440,35. Cell,4.4,2016,32000.0,1h 38m,R,"Considering I went into Cell with abysmally low expectations, it turned out to be not too bad. Not that this necessarily means that it&#39;s all good, but there are some good things I can say about this. I&#39;m pretty sure, from what I&#39;ve heard about the book (at best it&#39;s liked but not loved, sort of a middle-tier King work, not one of his triumphs but not a failure either, something fun he could knock off in a month or two as one of those &#39;hey this is happening in the real world, I&#39;ll use it for one of my spooktacular stories&#39; things) that this actually makes for an accurate assessment. It&#39;s a standard-issue zombie-ish story of people being infected and going bugf*** insane, only this time King (who also gets a screen writing credit) adds a kind of bird-pulse-hive-mind thing that only gets explained enough to move the plot along.Maybe in the book it was explained more or better; here, it seems like some weird and borderline lame (or just lame) device to keep us sort of on our toes, like, &#39;oh, hey, this time they&#39;re *not* vomiting blood on one another or eating brains, and any gunshot can kill them, not just the head, gotcha, thanks.&#39; But more lame than that is the generic story thing of &#39;well, my son and ex are somewhere, and I&#39;m gonna go find them&#39; when, naturally, it&#39;s not going to be pretty or something he likes when he finds out (that he being Cusack, who is doing the best he can with fairly weak-tea material). Meanwhile, Samuel L Jackson does his best Ken Foree (intentional or not) from Dawn of the Dead, and is a reason to see the movie - even in the midst of some mediocre writing or plotting, or moments that can make one groan, he&#39;s there to work and it&#39;s not something to be embarrassed about on his resume.As for the action, it&#39;s... fair. I guess I may be tired of seeing action shot with the shutter off (that&#39;s when the camera has this function that makes it go, oh, nevermind, you know it when you see it), and I think Tod Williams is a competent director of action but not one who can make things as thrilling as it should be. By the time you see one character go to a door slowly - not in this, I mean in any other movie you&#39;ve ever seen in your lives - you&#39;ve seen them all, and this has a lot of that. And while at one time I felt apprehensive about Eli Roth being the director, as he was attached for a period of time after the book first came out (his movies tend to be Dumb with a capital, sometimes double, D), now I&#39;d be curious as to what he might have changed or made more visceral or f***ed up.Cell goes through the motions, has some decent atmosphere, and a couple of those strange touches that I&#39;m sure come from that primordial cavern that is King&#39;s sub(or regular)consciousness - such as the whole aspect of how these beings screech and them come together (which is a fascinating sight to me), or Stacy Keach having the whole football stadium of infected asleep listening to the... is that the yodeling from that Christopher Lee mashup from LOTR online(?) But there&#39;s not enough of it to make it stand out; while I haven&#39;t seen enough of it to make a full comparison, my gut tells me this is, to the lay-person, Walking Dead lite, with some good actors doing their best and only rising to meet the absolute minimum required.... okay, maybe the ending is a little terrible, but my rating still stands."
tt0407304,36. War of the Worlds,6.5,2005,490000.0,1h 57m,PG-13,"What Spielberg, Cruise, and Koepp accomplish here in the first two acts is nothing short of revolutionary. They&#39;ve made a big-budget summer blockbuster about massive destruction and action that manages to studiously avoid every cliché and expectation of such films. It stays resolutely on the characters&#39; points of view, showing us almost nothing they don&#39;t see, even to the point of coming tantalizingly close to a raging battle, then avoiding showing it. It keeps its focus on character instead of spectacle. The &quot;hero&quot; of the piece remains decidedly unheroic, wanting only to escape, and trying to talk others out of fighting back. The purpose of every piece of action is to frighten and disturb rather than thrill, making ingenious use of familiar 9/11 imagery. At the end of the second act, it is hands-down the best alien invasion film ever made, and perhaps one of the best sci-films of all time.Then something strange happens. The filmmakers lose their nerve, and remember that this is an extremely expensive summer film financed by two studios. Or perhaps it was the fact that it stars Tom Cruise, who up to this point has spent almost two hours doing nothing but run for his life. Suddenly, and tragically, the film changes, violating not only its carefully established tone, but its own internal logic. Suddenly, Cruise begins to act like a hero, and summer action clichés force their way into the story like a worm into an apple. The transition is jarring, and it creates a serious disconnect from the story.While it&#39;s true that Wells&#39; original ending creates a problem for a movie, here they try to remain faithful to it, while still shoehorning moments of triumph into the conclusion. Unfortunately, these moments come off as alternately false, unbelievable, and meaningless, since it isn&#39;t mankind that defeats the invaders in the end.Is it recommendable? Well, I suppose that depends on what kind of viewer you are. If you feel that 75% brilliant material overshadows the 25% that falls apart, then you&#39;ll enjoy it. If, however, you&#39;re the kind of viewer who feels that the final impression a movie makes is its ultimate stamp on your memory, you may be in for a crushing disappointment. On the other hand, if you&#39;re the kind of viewer who just likes the cliché of the boom-boom summer action spectacle, you&#39;re likely to be bored and frustrated with the first two acts, and only engage in the end. It is confused about what audience it&#39;s trying to reach, and consequently, isn&#39;t likely to satisfy any of them."
tt0133152,37. Planet of the Apes,5.7,2001,238000.0,,PG-13,"If one wants to remake a movie, the best option is probably to choose and original that was good, but not a great classic. Clearly, any attempt to remake a concept that failed first time around is fraught with danger, but an attempt to remake a classic runs the risk that one&#39;s film will be unfavourably compared with the original. The original 1968 film of &#39;Planet of the Apes&#39; is one of cinema&#39;s great science fiction classics. More than an adventure story, it touches on some of the concerns of the late sixties- the fear of nuclear war, race relations- and also raises more fundamental issues about the relationship between man and nature, the relationship between religion and science, Darwinism and animal rights. It was therefore a brave move on Tim Burton&#39;s part to try and remake it. The main concept of Tim Burton&#39;s film is basically similar to Franklin Schaffner&#39;s. An astronaut from Earth travels to a planet ruled by intelligent apes. Humans exist on this planet, but they are regarded as an inferior species, despised and exploited by the apes. There is, however, an important difference. In the original film, the apes are the only intelligent and articulate beings on the planet. Although they have only attained a pre-industrial level of civilization (they have firearms, but no power-driven machinery, and no means of transport other than the horse or horse-drawn vehicles), they are a far more advanced species than the planet&#39;s human inhabitants, who lack the powers of speech and reason and live an animal-like existence. In Burton&#39;s remake, humans and apes have similar powers of speech and intellect; it is only the apes&#39; greater physical strength that enables them to dominate the planet and to treat the humans as slaves. It was this ironic role-reversal, with apes behaving like men and men behaving like beasts, that gave Schaffner&#39;s film its satirical power. That film was advertised with the slogan &#39;Somewhere in the Universe, there must be something better than man!&#39;, and the apes are indeed, in some respects, better than man. Their law against killing others of their kind, for example, is much more strictly observed than our commandment that &#39;Thou shalt do no murder&#39;. There is no sense that the apes are bad and the humans good. Even Dr Zaius, the orang-utan politician, is not a wicked individual; by the standards of his society he is an honourable and decent one. His weakness is that of excessive intellectual conservatism and unwillingness to accept opinions that do not fit in with his preconceived world view. (In this respect the apes are very human indeed). Burton&#39;s film takes a less subtle moral line. It is a straightforward story of a fight for freedom. The villains are most of the apes, especially the fanatical, human-hating General Thade. The heroes are Captain Davidson, the astronaut from Earth, the planet&#39;s human population who long for freedom from the domination of the apes, and a few liberal, pro-human apes, especially Ari, the daughter of an ape senator. The apes are more aggressive and more obviously animals than in the original film; they still frequently move on all fours and emit fierce shrieks whenever angry or excited. There are some things about this film that are good, especially the ape make-up which is, for the most part, more convincing than in the original film and allows the actors more scope to show emotion. (I say &#39;for the most part&#39; because Ari looks far less simian than do most of the other apes- Tim Burton obviously felt that the audience would be more likely to accept her as a sympathetic character if she looked half-human). The actors playing apes actually seem more convincing than those playing humans. Tim Roth is good as the militaristic Thade, as is Helena Bonham-Carter as Ari. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, is not an actor of the same caliber as Charlton Heston, who played the equivalent role in the original film, and Estella Warren has little to do other than look glamorous. (Heston has a cameo role as an ape in Burton&#39;s film, and even gets to repeat his famous line &#39;Damn you all to hell&#39;). Overall, however, the film is a disappointment when compared to the original, a simple science-fiction adventure story as opposed to an intelligent and philosophical look at complex issues. It tried to copy the device of a surprise ending but failed. Schaffner&#39;s famous final twist is shocking, but makes perfect sense in the context of what has gone before. Burton&#39;s makes no sense whatsoever.Tim Burton can be a director of great originality, but with &#39;Planet of the Apes&#39; he fell into the standard Hollywood trap of trying to copy what had already been done and remaking a film that never needed to be remade. It was good to see him return to form with the brilliant &#39;Big Fish&#39;, one of the best films of last year. 6/10"
tt0484740,38. Love in the Time of Cholera,6.4,2007,25000.0,2h 19m,R,"Quick, before the general release on Friday change the silent movie line back to &quot;My God, this is longer than sorrow&quot;. What did she mumble instead, was it &quot;interminable&quot;? Why was that wonderful line changed?I so loved the book, I cannot get an unbiased grip on the movie. My mind elaborated it favorably but with simultaneous disappointment over deviations like the &quot;sorrow&quot; line. &quot;Forever&quot; worked better in the book as the boat was ordered to return upstream. I do wish it had closed with the &quot;ripple&quot; video that is on the internet.The film touched too many threads while missing the book&#39;s soul, like trying to read Fermina&#39;s heart on her tongue. Maybe it isn&#39;t possible for a movie to do justice to any masterpiece but Florentino&#39;s long-standing relationships with the widows are as important as the &quot;body count&quot;. Young Fermina was too old, as was America. I would have cast a 15-year-old as the young Fermina and have had her reappear as America with died hair or similar artifice. I cannot forgive the script for ignoring the perversion and her suicide. I would have rather America had been entirely written out.Bardem was the perfect Florentino. Fernanda Montenegro and Hector Elizondo gave terrific performances. Marcela Mar is such a heart-throb I nearly forgive her for being twice her age. Cartagena was underplayed. The Shakira soundtrack was ideal.I&#39;ll reluctantly recommend the movie but won&#39;t shake peoples&#39; shoulders as I do when I tell them that they must read the book."
tt0319970,39. Carrie,5.4,2002,12000.0,2h 12m,Not Rated,"It seems to make as much sense to remake a great movie like Brian DePalma&#39;s 1976 horror/suspense masterpiece CARRIE for television as it did to make a sequel of it in the form of THE RAGE: CARRIE 2 three years before, but that&#39;s what has been done.  A lot of bells and whistles have been added to this television remake, but in the end this CARRIE is still in the shadow of the DePalma original.Angela Bettis (GIRL INTERRUPTED) has the unenviable task of stepping into the shoes (and the prom dress) of Sissy Spacek in the title role of a New England teen tortured at school by cruel classmates (because she doesn&#39;t belong) and at home by her religiously fanatical mother (Patricia Clarkson, in the Piper Laurie role).  Soon, she discovers she has telekinetic powers; and when the most gruesome of gags is played on her on prom night, all bets are off.Though looking much more glazed in the eyes than Spacek ever did, Bettis gives a fairly good performance as Carrie; and Clarkson&#39;s portrayal of her uprighteous mother is much more low-key, but no less threatening, than Laurie&#39;s portrayal.  The special effects, however obvious they might be, are also quite good.  But in the end, the reputation of the 1976 original, with its combination of psychological horror and teen-angst drama, still hovers over this remake.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the pig&#39;s blood scene.  It doesn&#39;t have the same jarring emotional impact this time around--not so much because we&#39;ve seen it before, but because here it looks slightly laughable when the blood gets poured onto Bettis.  Because of DePalma&#39;s use of slow-motion in the original, the blood hits Spacek like a tidal wave.I give the CARRIE remake a &#39;6&#39; just for trying.  I only regret that its shortcomings as a film have less to do with its execution as a film than the fact that the original movie still resonates much more fully."
tt0031381,40. Gone with the Wind,8.2,1939,346000.0,3h 58m,G,"I&#39;ve seen the film many times, have always enjoyed it. But I&#39;ve been reading the book for the first time. It&#39;s a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It&#39;s a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It&#39;s the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn&#39;t be introduced in the movie without extending the film&#39;s length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands."
tt0380599,41. Oliver Twist,6.8,2005,35000.0,2h 10m,PG-13,"Polanski is the kid of guy who likes to dance on the edge. A mixture of clown, genius and artist who has suffered personal tragedy and humiliation but one who keeps cranking amazing films. This Oliver Twist is no exception. Polanski has reworked the story and taken out the 19th century coincidences, e.g., the highly improbable fact that Oliver is Brownlow&#39;s grandson and the business with the portrait of Oliver&#39;s mother, given the old tale a fresh coat of paint with new amazing character actors such as Leanne Rowe, a young and thoroughly charming Nancy, Henry Eden, a scamp of a Dodger, Jamie Forman, a repulsive Bill Sykes with no redeeming features whatsoever and the veteran Edward Hardwicke as Brownlow. But, it&#39;s young Barney Clark who steals the show. In past versions, Oliver is merely a device upon which the other array of characters are hung. We&#39;ll all remember Sir Alec Guinness, Richard Dreyfus and Ron Moody&#39;s Fagin, Oliver Reed and Robert Newton&#39;s Bill Syke, Elijah Wood, Anthony Newley and Jack Wild&#39;s Dodger but who were the Olivers? We will remember young Master Barney Clark in this marvelous, intriguing and eye-pleasing Oliver."
tt0120815,42. Saving Private Ryan,8.6,1998,1600000.0,2h 49m,R,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don&#39;t know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don&#39;t take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I&#39;ll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable &quot;I can&#39;t watch this&quot; reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I&#39;m not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I&#39;ve seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why."
tt0137523,43. Fight Club,8.8,1999,2500000.0,2h 19m,R,"Fight Club does exactly what movies should do, blow our minds, make us ask questions of ourselves and our society, and all the while thoroughly entertain us. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are at their very best."
tt0268978,44. A Beautiful Mind,8.2,2001,1000000.0,2h 15m,PG-13,"A Beautiful Mind
Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience&#39;s heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin&#39;s kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he&#39;ll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He&#39;s socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia&#39;s a tough disease, folks - it&#39;s still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says &quot;Russell Crowe&quot;, you&#39;ll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he&#39;s playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he&#39;s unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they&#39;re exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he&#39;s a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a &quot;hunk&quot; - their skills as actors aren&#39;t seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash&#39;s acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that&#39;s the essence of Crowe&#39;s performance. It&#39;s sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she&#39;s the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn&#39;t an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don&#39;t know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I&#39;ll admit it, it got me right here. But it&#39;s okay; I did that old &#39;guy-crying-in-movie-theater&#39; trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won&#39;t think you&#39;re a girly man.At any rate, it&#39;s certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything&#39;s in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting."
tt0091605,45. The Name of the Rose,7.7,1986,123000.0,2h 10m,R,"A murder mystery set in a monastery in the late middle ages, at a time when the Franciscan order and the Holy Inquisition were at odds, mostly over the extravagances of the Papacy, is a dark and moody film, which matches the period of the story well. Once again Sean Connery takes a difficult role and makes it uniquely his. Fifteen year old Christian Slater is seen in his breakout role. But the real star of the film is the library of the monastery, a labyrinthine building that is many floors high and created with stairways that seem to always lead away from where you want to go. I found the book, frankly tedious. Umberto Eco writes in a style that is very pedantic at times, and just plain confusing at others. But the story translated well to the screen, but you must be willing to exhaust a little brain sweat to get anything out of the story. Be well rested before you watch this one."
tt0106246,46. Alive,7.1,1993,67000.0,2h 8m,R,"&quot;Alive&quot; is the kind of movie that you wouldn&#39;t believe if you didn&#39;t know in advance that it was based on true events. If you didn&#39;t know better, you would say it was all made up by some scenarist with too much of inspiration, looking for a spectacular and sometimes shocking script. But unfortunately enough it all really happened, which makes the movie interesting to watch.For those who don&#39;t know the story yet, it is based on what happened to the Uruguayan rugby team during and after their plane crash in the middle of the Andes mountains in 1972. Some of them survive the initial crash, some wounded, others only with some minor scratches. They pray that they will soon be found, but no search team is coming to rescue them. At first they keep themselves alive by eating what they find in the luggage of the passengers, but soon that food is also gone. If they don&#39;t eat, they will all die. And they need to gain strength, because they need to try to get help themselves. There is only one horrible solution: they will have to eat the dead people...Despite the fact that this may sound horrible to many, I must say that it isn&#39;t as bad as you may think. Of course you&#39;ll see them cut a piece out of the bodies and eat it, but it is done in a watchable way. I&#39;m sure that only the very faint of heart will not be able to watch it. It&#39;s a part of the story, but it is never shown in a too spectacular or sensational way.All in all this is a very interesting movie. I asked myself several times: &#39;What would you do if you were in that situation? Would you eat it or not?&#39; I&#39;m not sure, but I guess I would, but that&#39;s not why I tell you this. Just the fact that I was able to think about it in this way shows that it wasn&#39;t too bloody or with too much gore (I really don&#39;t like that). That&#39;s why I reward this movie with a 7.5/10."
tt0884328,47. The Mist,7.1,2007,358000.0,2h 6m,R,"If, two years ago, you told me that within a couple of years two excellent Stephen King film adaptations would be released, I would probably have laughed it off. Films like The Shining, Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Stand and 1408 are usually pretty far between (Note that I consider The Green Mile and Carrie to be the most over-rated King adaptations, so they do not appear here). I like most of the films that have been made from Stephen King novels, novellas, and short stories mainly because I like Stephen King, but I do not recommend many of them as truly good films.Frank Darabont&#39;s (writing and directing) The Mist adapts a horror novella of the same name. King&#39;s horror work has been the most difficult material to adapt, but this film is comparable to other genre stand-outs such as The Shining and 1408.A brief, dramatic thunderstorm is followed by a freak mist that descends on a small New England town. As the mist permeates the town, people congregate in the local supermarket and hardware store to stock up and gather supplies. David Drayton (Thomas Jane), his son (Nathan Gamble), and his neighbor (Andre Braugher) are among them. Tension builds as a steady stream of military vehicles pass through the mist headed south from a nearby base. But serious concern doesn&#39;t start until one of the locals runs to the supermarket with blood spatters on his clothing and talking of monsters in the mist.Indeed, there are horrors outside in the fog, but there are also horrors inside the market - as paranoia, irrationality and religion come into conflict with practical issues of survival.Unlike many horror films, The Mist examines fear and its effects realistically, looks at the horror created by forces beyond human control and the even more terrifying horror that fear creates through forces that are completely within our grasp - our own fears, our beliefs and our treatment of each other. It does so using a classic formula which is comparable to films like Night of the Living Dead and, more recently, Feast.The cinematography, editing and directing are all excellent. The acting is quite good - Marcia Gay Harden and William Sadler stood out for me - and the script is exactly where it needed to be for this adaptation.Highly recommended for King fans and horror fans. Recommended for Sci-Fi fans. Weakly recommended for average cinema-goers who are not generally interested in horror."
tt0112579,48. The Bridges of Madison County,7.6,1995,93000.0,2h 15m,PG-13,"Meryl Streep is absolutely astonishing. I forgot it was her ten seconds into the film. That opening breakfast scene where all of her story is written in her magnificent face. As an Italian I know there is no acting involved here. She IS Italian. She reminded me of Anna Magnani in &quot;Bellissima&quot; there is not a single false note. Clint Eastwood, clearly, dedicates the film to her and the results are pure magic. The film is based on an unreadable book- at least I couldn&#39;t get through it, in spite of the brevity of the volume - the film however, is bound to become a classic thanks to the powerful chemistry of the stars. If you love film,like I do, I recommend you to see it once and let yourself be taken away by the truths in Meryl&#39;s eyes then go again and take note. Look at every one of her moments, from how she closes the refrigerator door to her laughter. Look at her reaction when she discovers that Clint stopped at Bari, her home town, just because he thought the place was pretty. Look at her hands, her walk and then go back to her eyes. It&#39;s a treat of the first order. Clint, in front as well as behind the camera,does a miraculous job. I passionately recommend it, no matter how young you are."
tt1057500,49. Invictus,7.3,2009,171000.0,2h 14m,PG-13,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable &quot;Invictus&quot; exceeded all my expectations. It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it&#39;s told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the &quot;Rainbow Nation&quot;. Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon&#39;s performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film&#39;s running time (I didn&#39;t even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.Freeman&#39;s performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate &quot;Invictus&quot; to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let&#39;s hope it is.Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.PS. I&#39;m a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;, &quot;Gran Torino&quot;, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;, &quot;Letters From Iwo Jima&quot;, &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;,&quot;Bird&quot; and &quot;Invictus&quot;. Yes, it&#39;s really that good. &quot;Invictus&quot; is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.PPS. &quot;Invictus&quot; is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it&#39;s also about more than sport."

tt1242422,51. Cell 211,7.6,2009,72000.0,1h 53m,,"This movie likens that of a gemstone- raw, real, unique, crafty and incomparable. I watched this movie, my first Spanish movie in cinema, with English subtitles and frankly, i was impressed. Though now the only regret i have is not mastering the language before the show. If only i could pay more attention to the movie instead of the translated words running at the bottom.This is a story of a prison guard, Juan Oliver (played by Alberto A) who decided to go to work one day before he actually begins to &#39;make an impression&#39;. What awaits him later is a riot, which forced him to be locked in Cell 211 after suffering an injury to his head. He knows the only way to live is to be one of them, and so he acted as an inmate. But until when can he keep it to himself? He has to make peace with the rest of the inmates and gain the trust of their &#39;leader&#39; Malamadre (played by Luis Tosar) as they take hostage of high profile, terrorist-prisoners. He later learns an ugly news of his pregnant wife outside prison and his life is never the same again.This movie plays around the humanity of man and how corruption and distrust can affect a man&#39;s freedom and ultimately, his life. There were moments in the show. Obviously, the prison riot. The police riot scene later was well delivered straight to its core, which led to the falling domino pieces in the movie. The turning point of Juan&#39;s character was when he received the news about his wife. Fine acting by all the cast with amazing characterization, awesome cinematography and directing at every scene!The development of the plot is great, at points where it creates suspense left me on the edge of my seat. The blossoming relationship between Juan and Malamadre is well crafted, and believable- that i don&#39;t see in many other movies these days. It felt like Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Walking out the cinema, i was left to ponder at many questions with respect to the show. Why was Juan left in Cell 211 at the first place? As if a curse is cast to the cell. It will be interesting to watch the Hollywood remake of the movie in two years time and i hope it does remain to its authenticity. Definitely award-worthy, it accentuates prison drama at its best- pulling heartstrings despite its violence and vulgar language.My cinematic experience has truly broadened. And i am sure yours will too after watching this movie."
tt1305806,52. The Secret in Their Eyes,8.2,2009,232000.0,2h 9m,R,"&quot;El Secreto de sus Ojos&quot; hit me with unspeakable strength. I didn&#39;t expect to like it so much, so I owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.First off, Campanella works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film. It even starts with a double exposure effect, mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful Buenos Aires that hints the spectacle ahead of us. One shot especially, from a chopper in a soccer field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking. Nothing to envy from Hollywood upper class.But the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion Director Campanella has over characters, spaces and silences. Many moments are coldly tense, scary and very, very intense. This crossover from genres by Campanella couldn&#39;t have been better. Crime stories often fall in common places, this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it&#39;s intense dialog, acting and scenes.I cannot stop recommending it, Argentina can open it&#39;s market with movies such as this. It has many, many memorable moments, it interwines comedy perfectly and it is doubtful you will instantly forget it, as it is so well constructed. See it if you can!"

This is one of those films that is often referred to by critics as being very important. When I read the description of it, my first reactions was to totally avoid it. But it has in it some really great actors and I&#39;ve been taken with the guy from Elementary. Well, was I surprised. While it was hard to watch as these young men dropped into the depths of addiction, I began to be fascinated by them. They were individuals who had aspirations and lives; they were good and bad. But were continually brought down by their mistakes. Those who say this glorifies drugs have totally missed the point."
tt0142688,54. The Ninth Gate,6.7,1999,204000.0,2h 13m,R,"Unscrupulous book dealer Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is drawn into a dangerous world of witchcraft, magic, and mystery after he is hired by collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) to seek out the only remaining copies of Satanic textbook &#39;The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows&#39;, a work reputed to have the power to summon the Devil.After several viewings, I still don&#39;t fully comprehend everything about The Ninth Gate: it&#39;s one of those film that is deliberately ambiguous. Despite my frustration at my lack of understanding, I still have a fun time trying to further unravel the riddle, spot as-yet undiscovered clues and diabolical references, and work out the answers to questions posed by the plot.While the film&#39;s inconclusive narrative does little to diminish my enjoyment of this wonderfully complex supernatural thriller, which benefits from excellent direction from Polanski, a great leading performance from Depp, and a suitably ominous score, I do struggle with the way in which the bibliophiles portrayed treat their treasured tomes, smoking fags and slurping alcohol as they study the text, handling the books sans protective gloves, and leaving vital pages to gather dust on top of old bookshelves—I treat second-hand paperbacks better than that!7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."
tt0159365,55. Cold Mountain,7.2,2003,160000.0,2h 34m,R,"&#39;War movie&#39; is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.Then again, calling Cold Mountain&quot; a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts &quot;Glory&quot; director Edward Zwick shame. However, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier&#39;s tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada&#39;s cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada&#39;s rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby&#39;s deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern &quot;lawman,&quot; and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by &quot;the war of Northern aggression,&quot; mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it&#39;s hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.Make no mistake, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether."
tt0092965,56. Empire of the Sun,7.7,1987,138000.0,2h 33m,PG,"I had put off watching this until recently, I do not know why, I had not read reviews and for some reason imagined it to be a movie about a young Japanese prince(!!).I was captivated by the performance of Christian Bale as a privileged young boy named Jim Graham, growing up in Shanghai, very far removed from the poverty and despair all around him. When war breaks out, this changes him forever and hence the story.After some harrowing experiences he winds up in a prisoner of war camp where he befriends some interesting characters and quickly adapts to a life of conniving and subterfuge to survive.The transformation of Jim is beautifully captured, Steven Spielberg is a gifted director of child actors and gets a maximum performance always.I was enthralled from beginning to end, young Jim was forever changed by his experiences and this change is portrayed starkly here when he is finally reunited with his parents.8 out of 10 for equally impressive performances from John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson, but Christian Bale&#39;s performance deserved an Oscar."
tt0100054,57. Lord of the Flies,6.4,1990,35000.0,1h 30m,R,"I&#39;ve read the book so many times and after seeing the first 1963 adaptation of the movie I admit I was a little let down. I was surprised they didn&#39;t put in the Simon scene (which is probably one of the most important scenes in the book) and a lot of other important things they missed out on. But then, once I found out there was another version of the movie I quickly rented it. But let me tell you something; This is movie is much worse than the first one, and does an awful job of telling the storyline. Although the boys were very adorable (I&#39;ll admit that)that still didn&#39;t make up for the bad acting job they did. Plus, I was really confused on why the director chose to make a nonexistent captain the most important symbol in the book. Why he did that is beyond me. So anyways, my point is, if your looking for a good movie based on the book, you should probably just stick to the first one, and don&#39;t waste your money on renting/buying this movie."
tt0488604,58. The Oxford Murders,6.1,2008,31000.0,1h 48m,R,"I had high hopes for &quot;The Oxford Murders&quot;, a new Straight-to-DVD film starring Elijah Wood and John Hurt, and most of those hopes were slowly let down as I watched the movie.The film follows Martin (Wood), an American who travels to Oxford to write his thesis under the legendary mathematician Arthur Seldom (Hurt), and finds an angry, pompous old man instead of the wise and caring fellow he had imagined. Disillusioned, Martin is about to return home when he and Seldom find a dead body. The rest of the film covers Martin and Seldom&#39;s race against time to find the killer, using the mathematical theories that both are knowledgeable about.The film is pretty bland. It&#39;s characters, save the amazing John Hurt, are one-dimensional. Martin is boring and unengaging and Elijah Wood does nothing to improve his script. The same can be said of Julie Cox and especially Leonar Watling. John Hurt is the only reason I finished, really. His acting skill is not at home in the world of blandness.You could do better than &quot;The Oxford Murders&quot;, but if you&#39;re not looking for too much it will suffice."
tt0073540,59. Picnic at Hanging Rock,7.4,1975,43000.0,1h 55m,PG,"Even though this has been described as a film about sexual repression (and Peter Weir may have thought he was making such a film), I don&#39;t think it is--rather, it is a celebration of the dreamy, self contained sexuality (or rather pre-sexuality) of young adolescent girls just before they seriously turn their attention to men. Sure, they may be living in a society straitjacketed by Victorian mores, but the girls really don&#39;t seem to be the unhappier for this, non withstanding the earthy maid&#39;s comments that she feels sorry for them. Miranda and her friends seem completely content and at ease in their languid, hothousey world of poetry, pink and white bedrooms, and mutual crushes (I was reminded of the similarly dreamy, self contained little universe of the sisters in &quot;The Virgin Suicides--another film that is supposedly about repression). During the noon day nap at Hanging Rock, the girls, heads resting in one another&#39;s laps, are in a state very much resembling post coital bliss--far from seeming repressed, they are among the most content women I&#39;ve ever seen on screen. It is quite arguable that Victorian morality had something to do with their sexuality turning inward like this, but all this does is lend credence to the truism that repression intensifies sexuality--which may explain the lingering fascination the Victorian era has for the modern age, and why one of its most striking symbols of its oppressiveness--the corset--is also very erotically charged. The girls&#39; disappearance into the eerie black land form (that seems to have faces at times, bringing to mind fairy tales about trolls who steal golden haired children) suggests that at in their present state they are so contented that anything else life might hold for them could only be a letdown, that only whatever dark force (death? nothingness?) is haunting Hanging Rock could possibly be a worthy enough lover for these girls who are already so supremely self fulfilled. There are, unfortunately, aspects of this film that don&#39;t work, or rather jar with the elements discussed above, the most prominent of these being the Dickensian subplot of the persecuted orphaned pupil Sarah. The actress herself is affecting in her part and her boyish beauty contrasts well with Miranda&#39;s ethereal femininity (she looks like a young Renaissance prince at times), but her story really belongs in another movie because at heart &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; is more Gothic than socially conscious.Maybe Weir really was aiming to make a movie about the evils of sexual repression, class inequality or even colonization, but such possible themes are blown away by the languid, ethereal images of the young adolescent girls at the beginning of the film, floating contentedly through their hours like clusters of Monet lilies."
tt0083658,60. Blade Runner,8.1,1982,853000.0,1h 57m,R,"In the future year of 2019, a group of four replicas arrive on Earth in search of their creator, Blade Runner Rick Deckard is persuaded into hunting them down.Love it or hate it, one thing that can&#39;t be questioned, is the amount of movies that this film inspired. Blade Runner was a ground breaking movie, one that was way ahead of its time.Blade Runner is up there with Dune for me as one of the greatest movies to come out of the 80&#39;s, I would definitely deem it as a classic, it&#39;s so watchable.The best element for me, the visuals, this is one the truly exquisite looking film, consider the era it was made in, and the lack of sophisticated special effects and tech, this is a triumph of creativity.I know pacing is an issue for some, and storytelling has changed with time, but the pace here is very deliberate, it develops and builds, it&#39;s there to give you a sense of unease. Don&#39;t expect action at every turn, that&#39;s not the purpose of the film.The music of Vangelis is terrific throughout, it adds to the film, and never imposes or tries to overtake.I always love seeing someone&#39;s vision of the future, and the future world is wonderfully imaginative and perfectly realised, though still wonderfully 1980&#39;s, so there&#39;s plenty of punk and glam, big hair, clear plastic jackets and eye shadow galore. One thing that was spot on, a greater coming together of cultures.A recent news article about AI made me think of this film, scientists are warning about the threat posed by AI development, after watching this film again, I can see where they&#39;re coming from.Harrison Ford is great, perfectly cast as Deckard, another of his iconic roles. Rutger Hauer also manages to captivate and terrify.This is a classic, quality movie.9/10."
tt0395119,61. Captain Alatriste: The Spanish Musketeer,6.1,2006,14000.0,2h 25m,,"I went to see this movie without reading the books first and with only a vague knowledge of the historical events the novels are based upon. Apparently, the director thought that it would be a good idea to condensate the five Alatriste novels in a single film, in order to give depth to the characters. A big mistake. The pace is for the most part too fast and anecdotic, and the action jumps from here to there without ever giving a clear reason why everyone behaves the way they do, from the romantic plots scattered along the movie to the great political conspiracies. It is never very clear either why Alatriste, who is little more than a soldier and hired assassin, is so important to so many people of high rank.In spite of all this, I cannot give the film a bad rating because it is certainly a pleasure to watch. The technical aspects, the general &quot;look&quot; of the film, the music, and the acting are splendid. The casting can be a controversial point, but the chosen actors do wonders."

tt0106918,64. The Firm,6.9,1993,154000.0,2h 34m,R,"In this excitingly convoluted genre piece by Sydney Pollack---who blossomed into a straightforwardly commercial director who was happily a part of the commercial mainstream, unlike such surviving contemporaries as Sidney Lumet and Woody Allen---Tom Cruise plays Mitch McDeere, a poor boy who is embarrassed by his meager roots now that he has graduated from Harvard Law fifth in his class. He gets offers from the top law firms in New York and Chicago, yet ultimately opts for a smaller firm stationed in Memphis. His choice is money-minded. He regards money as peace of mind, however later in the film he is less certain than he&#39;s ever been of how flush he&#39;d need to have to be truly at peace.Some movies about the law reduce the judiciary elements to the rank of incidental. This one squeezes them for all they&#39;re worth. Without betraying too much of the story, I can say that McDeere is soon enough being blackmailed by both the FBI and the firm&#39;s security chief, grizzled and mild Wilford Brimley, quite compelling in an unusual jaunt as a bad guy. To protect himself, Mitch has to exercise both mind and body, eluding hit men and outwitting lawyers, to save both his life and his license to practice law.Drawn from the novel by John Grisham, as adapted by three of the most high-priced screenwriters at the time, this star-studded suspense melodrama takes an admirable two and a half hours to work its way through a hair-splitting ethical hodgepodge. By the finale, regardless of McDeere&#39;s gasping expounding during phone calls in the middle of a chase sequence, his plan of action is bewildering. And then there is the one character who never saw two particular killers when she witnessed another character&#39;s death because she was totally enclosed and hidden, which is how she survived, but in a later scene with Mitch, she says she saw the killers and details what they looked like, even the color of one&#39;s eyes, the one actually being an albino. However, it doesn&#39;t seem as far-fetched as it would were the style of the movie not as competent even when the fine points were bleary.Sydney Pollack, usually a solid director of easy-going entertainment, liked to make big, demanding movies and he was secure working with huge stars. Whether or not that colors his movies with a sugar-coated worthiness, he utilized them as abbreviated exposition. Case in point: One glance at Hal Holbrook as the top dog of the Firm and we sense it&#39;s a suspicious organization. Holbrook almost always plays the ostensibly dignified man with skeletons in his closet. One look at Gene Hackman, as the law partner who becomes Cruise&#39;s coach, and we know he&#39;s an incredibly faulty yet essentially not such a bad man, as he always is. One look at Cruise and we get a complacent feeling, because he is, in lots of his roles, just a little slow to figure things out. His characters appear to trust people too readily, and so it seems authentic when he accepts the Firm&#39;s song and dance and inducements.The movie is practically a compilation of great small character performances. Ed Harris, menacing with a shaved head, mainly requires little more than a couple of concise appearances to persuasively disclose the FBI&#39;s case against the Firm, and to divulge its airy readiness to force a potential witness to undergo impossible duress. Another potent performance is by David Strathairn, as the brother McDeere hasn&#39;t told the Firm about. Strathairn has arisen as one of the most commanding character actors around. There are also rich performances by Gary Busey, as an articulate private eye, and especially by Holly Hunter, as his allegiant secretary. Actually, watching this high falutin&#39; legal thriller, it hit me that law firms have to some extent usurped Army platoons as Hollywood&#39;s most enjoyed universal human setting. The new law thrillers have the same components as those reliable old World War II action films: Assorted cultural and character archetypes who battle each other when they&#39;re not battling the enemy. The law movies have one formidable leg-up: the female characters engage equally in the fray, rather than simply cooking, cleaning and writing letters.The vast peanut gallery of characters makes The Firm into a persuasive Hollywood landscape. There are enough convincing people here to give McDeere a genuine environment to inhabit. And Pollack was forbearing inwith some ways with his material. He would allow a scene to go on until the point was made somewhat more acutely. That would let an actor like Hackman be stunningly compelling in scenes where he delicately authenticates that, in spite of everything, he has a decent soul. A sensitive scene near the climax between Hackman and Tripplehorn is like an advanced course in acting. The parts of The Firm seem better than the whole. And there are some great parts."
tt0109446,65. The Client,6.7,1994,77000.0,1h 59m,PG-13,"Susan Sarandon should stick with the tough minded lawyer more often. Perfectly cast in the role of Reggie Love, she brings a certain charm to a role which could have lacked in that department. And to make matters even tougher on her, she was almost outshined by Brad Renfro, who made quite an impression in a film such as this. While the film was put together in a rather conventional way, with Tommy Lee Jones playing an over clichéd character, the film is still rather gripping. A decent film to have in your collection, and one of the better John Grisham book-turned-movie adaptations."

His grandson Adam (Chris O&#39;Donnell) has been avoiding the hateful legacy of his Klan grandfather. The young lawyer takes on the case. His investigation reveals that others were involved and he struggles to stop the execution.Gene Hackman is a great racist but his character is irredeemable. Chris O&#39;Donnell has his boyish looks but I don&#39;t sense the substance. Faye Dunaway is simply horrible in this one. The story is flat. The legal thriller is ultimately meaningless.

Survival, even for a man who owned the land, took a different strength of character. Is it good, or is it regretful those times have passed? More money yes, but were better times up North in the auto plants? I suppose, but this is nostalgia, and not bad either.It was a good family movie, narrated like the Waltons, I kept waiting for &quot;goodnight Luke-boy&quot;. Yah, Little House on the Prairie too, a bit more reality, but did other commenters really expect this to be as complete as the book, any book? Personally, I&#39;m tired of hearing book-readers whine about &quot;what they left out&quot;. Don&#39;t watch movies if you read the book. This is certainly wandering reminiscences, but that&#39;s another type of literature too, isn&#39;t it? Why does every story have to be going somewhere special? To me it&#39;s a pretty good coming of age movie and worth the hour and a half at least, and always a pleasure watching Scott Glenn, when he gets good parts."
tt0119196,69. The Gingerbread Man,5.7,1998,12000.0,1h 54m,R,"Robert Altman shouldn&#39;t make a movie like this, but the fact that he did- and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly-wound thriller in that paperback-tradition of Grisham thrillers- shows a versatility that is commendable. In the Gingerbread Man he actually has to work with something that, unfortunately, he isn&#39;t always very successful at, or at least it&#39;s not the first thing on his checklist as director: plot. There&#39;s one of those big, juicy almost pot-boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low-class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways, twists and plot ensues, yada yada. And it&#39;s surprising that Altman would really want to take on one of these &quot;I saw that coming from back there!&quot; endings, or just a such a semi-conventional thriller.But it&#39;s a surprise that pays off because, oddly enough, Altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior, or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well-cast ensemble, of a small-town Georgian environment. The film drips with atmosphere (if not total superlative craftsmanship, sometimes it&#39;s good and sometimes just decent for Altman), as Savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid. So the atmosphere is really potent, but so are performances from (sometimes) hysterical Kenneth Branaugh, Embeth Davitz as the &#39;woman&#39; who lawyer Branaugh gets caught up with, and Robert Downey Jr (when is he *not* good?) as the private detective in Branaugh&#39;s employ. Did I neglect Robert Duvall, who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad-vibes of the picture on? As said, some of the plot is a little weak, or just kind of standard (lawyer is divorced, bitter custody battle looms, innocent and goofy kids), but at the same time I think Altman saw something captivating in the material, something darker than some of the other Grisham works that has this standing out somehow. If it&#39;s not entirely masterful, it still works on its limited terms as a what-will-happen-next mystery-Southern-noir."
tt0119978,70. The Rainmaker,7.2,1997,86000.0,2h 15m,PG-13,"A story about an aspiring young lawyer who tries to break down an insurance company, Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, a Memphis St. Law School graduate who can&#39;t seem to find a job anywhere, until he meets &quot;Bruiser&quot; Stone (Mickey Rourke). Stone is an ambulance chaser, who does whatever it takes, legal or not, to win a case. Rudy, as most law students are when they graduate, wants to take the high road, do everything by the book, and win. What he finds is that sometimes you need to get down and dirty to help your client. In this case, his client is a young boy, dying of leukemia. Seems the insurance company won&#39;t pay for a bone marrow transplant that would save his life. Rudy sets out to help the young man and his family, in what turns out to be one of the biggest cases Tennessee has ever seen. Along with his partner Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), Rudy sets out to try and prove to the world that the insurance company is nothing more than a big time scam artist. Along the way Rudy meets (and falls in love with) a young woman (Clare Danes) who gets beat up regularly by her husband. This part of the story seemed somewhat strange to me. I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was there to do. Was it to give Rudy a love interest? Was it just to give the movie another case so the entire film wasn&#39;t centered on the insurance trial? I feel it gave the movie some heart, and showed that Rudy would fight for what he believed in, both in court and in life. But I think the movie could have been done without it. I enjoyed the trial scenes and all the grunt work that went behind it (being a future lawyer myself (I hope)). And the cast was wonderful. Each person added a little more to the movie, and each gave a great performance. Danny Glover as the (2nd) judge gave a little humor to the movie, but also made you feel good about Rudy&#39;s chances in court. He was going to play fair, but hew as also going to give Rudy the benefit of the doubt. Jon Voight played the insurance company&#39;s lead lawyer, and he played his character to it&#39;s swarmy best. He is what people think lawyers are like, out only for money; win at all costs, no soul (I know attorneys like that). And he was convincing. And of course DeVito and Damon carried the film. I had my doubts about Damon playing a lawyer, but the more I watched, the more I realized that he looked like people I see at work everyday. He had the same fear in his eyes that we all do, but also that dog-eat-dog determination to prove to the world that he could do the job. The Rainmaker was more about the performances than the story. And the performances won me over. Give it a shot, it&#39;s worth it."

Papeles en el viento,6.1,2015,1100.0,1h 38m,,"The movie is about three friends, lifelong fans of the Independiente football team, knowing each other since childhood from the neighborhood: Pablo Echarri today is a hotshot lawyer, Diego Pereti is a high school teacher, Pablo Rago tries to make a living (but usually fails) selling stuff at various stores. A fourth friend, Diego Torres, has died recently of cancer. The friend that died was the owner of the rights to a mediocre football player, playing now in the regional leagues, and the movie is basically about how these three, who have inherited the rights to the player, engage in various schemes to try to sell this player to top football teams far above its real price. The schemes they engage are quite dishonest (for example, we see them making a fake video of the player, stealing a car, bribing a journalist to hype the player) but we are asked to find their dishonesty lovable, since it&#39;s all done not to enrich themselves but to help the daughter of their late friend. While the movie is well acted and directed and holds our interest, its mixture of saccharine sentimentality with its praise of dishonesty leave us with a bad taste.

tt3402236,72. Murder on the Orient Express,6.5,2017,310000.0,1h 54m,PG-13,"This movie was clearly made for a modern audience with no familiarity with Agatha Christie&#39;s work. Branagh&#39;s portrayal of the legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot bares only a passing resemblance to the source material with an inconsistent accent, the wrong mustache, and only some of his iconic quirks and mannerisms. That being said, it is a decent mystery that follows the plot of the story pretty well and it would probably be enjoyable to people seeing the story for the first time and having no preconceived notions of what Poirot should be.A strong supporting cast featuring Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, and many other familiar faces performs well. However, no one stands out in the way Ingrid Bergman did in the 1974 adaptation or Jessica Chastain in the 2010 version.There were also several semi-action moments that were incredibly out of character for Poirot, yet provided no actual excitement to justify the sudden stylistic change. The ending hints at Death on the Nile being the next mystery for this detective masquerading as Poirot to tackle, but Poirot should not be summoned to solve a murder, he simply stumbles upon them whenever he goes on vacation."

Crooked House,6.3,2017,29000.0,1h 55m,PG-13,"As a Christie fan who was not familiar with this particular story, this feels much bleaker than the average novel by Dame Agatha.It&#39;s a competent whodunit, well-cast, well-performed. The second act feels a little slow, all the more because nearly every character is sour, bitter and miserable; they lack a certain variety in tone which could have made the dialogue more lively.Still, it&#39;s a solid effort and I was genuinely surprised by the denouement, which I won&#39;t spoil.6,5/10"
tt0070511,74. Papillon,8.0,1973,142000.0,2h 31m,R,"Usually, after reading a long book filled with many interesting adventures, watching a two-hour film later winds up being a big disappointment. There is no way a film can give you anywhere near the info you glean from a book, especially one over 500 pages as is the case with &quot;Papillion.&quot; Yet, despite most of Henri Charriere&#39;s incredible feats of survival, (&quot;Papillion&quot; was Charriere&#39;s nickname) this movie is above average and basically does the book justice. The movie runs about two-and-a-half hours and gives enough of a flavor to have the viewer appreciate - at least to some degree - the brutal trials and tribulations Papillion went through in real life.If you enjoyed this film, the book is a &quot;must-read&quot; for you and very highly-recommend You won&#39;t believe all the things Charriere experienced: good and bad. In real life, the man escaped something like eight times and each time went through hell.Steve McQueen, playing &quot;Papillion,&quot; was excellent. He was particularly good at showing the physical effects of years of solitary confinement. By the way, in real life, Charriere was much younger went sent to jail than McQueen was at the time this movie was shot. Papillion should have been played by a younger actor, but who&#39;s going to complain when you get an actor of McQueen&#39;s caliber? Dustin Hoffman also was great as Papillion&#39;s friend, &quot;Louis Dega,&quot; who had a bigger role in the movie than he did in the book. For the most part, Papillion had a number of friends, all helping him over the years. Hoffman also provided some good comic relief to the movie and, heaven knows, it needed it. Take it from someone who has read the book: this is a grim story, worse than what you saw on screen here.Nevertheless, thanks to the two leading actors and the wonderful work by Director Franklin Schaffner and Cinematograher Fred Koenekamp, this long film entertained. No, it wasn&#39;t the caliber of the book, but it&#39;s didn&#39;t insult it, either, and is definitely worth a look."
tt0048918,75. 1984,6.9,1956,4500.0,1h 30m,Not Rated,"I saw the movie once back in 1968 or so and thought it was great. Don&#39;t know how I&#39;d view it now but I have never had any desire to see the remake. The fact that the movie is in black and white still leaves a very visual impression of the stark, bare lives people like Winston Smith led. No color in their lives and certainly no color in their thoughts was the order of their day. I think the film captured that along with the idea that their technology available was also unenlightening. It served only one purpose and that was to control. I don&#39;t think I would be as impressed if the movie were made today. Our technology is too sophisticated. In the original version, less is more."
tt0317248,76. City of God,8.6,2002,836000.0,2h 10m,R,"Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IMDb boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made.Based on true events and characters who live in the overlooked and poverty stricken slums in the shadows of Rio de Janiero, where life expectancy doesn&#39;t reach the 30&#39;s and drug dealers are kings.The tale of the City of God, and its myriad of characters is told by Rocket, a young man who struggles to make something of his life, other than to wind up another victim of drugs or gang wars.Not only are the characters in City of God absolutely fascinating, and also very endearing, but also convincingly acted by groups of young and unknown actors. The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film. In every sense, a bit of a Brazillian &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, but with its own unique flavour to it.The City of God is a marvel, and a highly recommended film to watch, but not recommended for the over-sensitive or easily distressed."
tt0100157,77. Misery,7.8,1990,250000.0,1h 47m,R,"Misery is without a doubt one of the finest movies of the 90&#39;s and one of the best movies in the thriller genre. It is an ingeniously crafted horror masterpiece that seamlessly intertwines its incredibly tense and cleverly paced story with inventive cinematography, tight editing and exquisite performances. In my opinion Misery is one of the better adaptations of Stephen King&#39;s works and truly a movie that cannot be missed, especially for the genre fans.Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is the author of a successful series of romance novels about a character called Misery, who decides to take a more serious approach regarding his future novels. On his way to publish his new manuscript, Paul drives from his hotel in Silver Creek to New York. Due to the extreme weather conditions, he has an accident that leaves him severely injured and hopeless. A local nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) finds Paul and brings him to her remote home in order to help him recover. Claiming to be his number one fan, Annie discovers that in his last Misery novel her favorite character dies and then her obsession about him takes a dark and twisted turn as a long story of captivity and abuse begins.The direction by Rob Reiner is phenomenal and on a Hitchcockian level as the film has a plethora of perfectly crafted suspenseful moments that have the audience on the edge of their seats from the beginning till the amazing climax. The editing of the movie is also flawless, as the shots are specifically designed to induce tension in any moment they can. The cinematographer and Reiner both ace the perilous atmosphere of the picture, using close up shots of the moonfaced Wilkes both in her fits of rage and kindness which magnifies the polar extremes that Wilkes is prone to unexpectedly visit. What is also triumphed is the slow convergence of the audience and Paul Sheldon. The movie received a lot of critical acclaim, especially due to Kathy Bates&#39; chilling and memorable performance as Anny Wilkes that earned her the 1990&#39;s leading actress Oscar award, which remains the only Oscar ever given to a Stephen King film adaptation. No matter how great Kathy Bates&#39; Oscar-winning performance is, James Caan&#39;s cannot go unnoticed as it definitely qualifies as one of the best performances in his extensive career, despite how demanding and challenging his role as Paul Sheldon was.In conclusion, Misery is a dark and tense masterpiece that is an amalgamation of excellent direction, skillful writing, taut editing, amazing cinematography and stellar performances, which succeeds into creating the feeling of captivity and helplessness that the thriller genre was purposefully built for, and that makes it one of the best movies of the 90&#39;s and one absolute classic in its genre."
tt0098084,78. Pet Sematary,6.5,1989,120000.0,1h 43m,R,"A doctor (Dale Midkiff) and his family move to a new home, dangerously close to a busy highway. After the death of the family cat, the doctor&#39;s neighbor lets him in on a secret: there is a sacred Indian burial ground where buried pets come back to life. The obvious question is: does it work on people? Not to say this is a bad film (it&#39;s not), but the thing about this one is that its reputation and cultural impact have overshadowed the film itself. We all know that burying things in the sacred ground will bring them back to life, and that&#39;s without even having to see this film.There is much good to say about this one: an amazing talent in Gage Creed, the little boy. Some nice violence and gore (including an Achilles tendon slice). One of the most painful things I&#39;ve seen on film, when the doctor falls out of bed (I admit I winced a bit).Mike Mayo points out that this is something of a variation on &quot;The Monkey&#39;s Paw&quot;, and we agree it&#39;s a praiseworthy version. He says the film &quot;lasts 30 seconds too long&quot;, and I see his point, but cannot comment on that here. Howard Maxford is considerably more critical (as usual -- he is the most negative horror critic I know) and says it is &quot;over-extended&quot; and could have made a good half hour of television.Stephen King has made some good films and some bad ones (how much this is his fault or the fault of the directors is debatable). This falls firmly in the good category. Not among his very best (&quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; is number one), but still worth a few watches."
tt0085382,79. Cujo,6.1,1983,53000.0,1h 33m,R,"I think of Cujo as &quot;realistic horror&quot; because it is something that could really happen. People really do get killed by rabid dogs...this film just exaggerates the truth a bit. I can&#39;t say I really enjoyed this film as it is not what I look for in horror films. It&#39;s a very good film - well acted, well directed, suspenseful and emotional, but it&#39;s not really &quot;fun&quot; to watch. It starts off with the dog getting infected, and from then on tension is built up slowly as you sense the dog is getting angrier and angrier. Eventually it snaps and starts killing people. The bulk of the film focuses on when Donna and her son are trapped in the broken down car because Cujo attacks whenever they try to leave. You can feel all the desperation, pain and isolation of Donna and her son as they lay trapped inside. It makes you think twice about dogs and certainly what you would do in such a situation. Would you run, attack the dog, or wait until help arrives? This is not a fun, campy or cheesy horror film, so don&#39;t watch if you&#39;re a fan of cheese. It&#39;s for those who want to feel suspense, fear and pain."
tt0085333,80. Christine,6.8,1983,97000.0,1h 50m,R,"John Carpenter adapts Stephen King&#39;s novel with skillful precision. A high school kid becomes obsessive in his feelings for a very strange car he has bought. The car is given the name Christine and repays her owner&#39;s adoration by &quot;taking care of&quot; his enemies.It is fun watching Keith Gordon, owner of Christine, go from wimp to self proclaimed stud. Also in the cast are: John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Harry Dean Stanton and David Spielberg.It is super cool watching Christine repair her damaged parts. This is an underrated movie that deserves a repeat viewing."
tt3631112,81. The Girl on the Train,6.5,2016,206000.0,1h 52m,R,"This is an excellent mystery/thriller that had me &#39;grasping at straws&#39; for a solid hour or so, trying to figure out who was &#39;good&#39; and who was &#39;bad.&#39; And...it&#39;s punctuated with a &quot;killer ending!&quot; (Yes, pun intended ~)Plot in a nutshell: An alcoholic loner subject to blackouts (Emily Blunt) immerses herself in a missing-persons case in which she becomes a prime suspect.(First let me state I have not read the novel on which this film is based. So my review and impressions are formed solely from watching the movie, where they should be. It seems most of the negative reviews here are from people who read the novel, then apparently watched this film with a notepad in hand, already knowing the story and the outcome but eagerly marking down every area that doesn&#39;t match the book, and then coming here to write negative reviews to vent about it. No offense to them (or you, if you are one of them), but the point here is to review the FILM - not to compare and contrast the film to the novel (or to anything else, for that matter). If you want to write a review of the book, go to Goodreads.com and write it there! This site is for the film, and it&#39;s what I want to know about. All of these reviews on here telling me about the book, and then giving a poor rating because the film isn&#39;t exactly like the book, are irrelevant and out of place. Let&#39;s talk about the FILM....)And yes, it&#39;s a very good one. Emily Blunt does such a masterful job of playing an alcoholic social outcast, I agree with some others on here wondering why she wasn&#39;t even nominated for an Academy Award. It&#39;s that good. She plays one of three women around whom the story largely revolves (Rebecca Ferguson and Haley Bennett are the others). These three are all loosely connected in various ways that are not obvious at first but, through flashbacks and story shifts, we are gradually shown how they tie together. One of the three goes missing and the plot then shifts to solving that mystery. Saying much more than this will ruin the story so I&#39;ll draw the line there. But I will say I found this to be highly entertaining and was constantly shifting my opinion as to who was the guilty one. At one point I guessed right (as it turned out) but I changed my opinion based on what was happening, only to find out I had been right 20 minutes ago! But that&#39;s the beauty of this film - just when you think you&#39;ve got it figured out, you are given a new shred of information that makes you question everything you&#39;d accepted before. That&#39;s good story-telling and worthy of acclaim. It&#39;s not a stretch to say &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot; comes from the same mold as the Agatha Christie and Alfred Hitchcock classics. If you like those, you&#39;ll probably like this too.8/10. Effective and intriguing mystery that deserves a much higher rating than it&#39;s current 6.5 here. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Yes."
tt0289765,82. Red Dragon,7.2,2002,302000.0,2h 4m,R,"Red Dragon is based on the novel of the same name written by Thomas Harris and is directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally. It stars Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Mary-Louise Parker &amp; Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Dante Spinotti is on cinematography and Danny Elfman scores the music.Red Dragon is a prequel to the hugely successful Silence of the Lambs. The story had already been filmed as Manhunter in 1986 directed by Michael Mann. The signs weren&#39;t particularly good for Red Dragon. The previous year had seen Ridley Scott tackle Silence Of The Lambs follow up, Hannibal, with tepid results. While at the helm here was the director of such fodder as Rush Hour 1&amp;2, and of course Mann&#39;s take on the story is viewed as a grainy and skin itching cult classic. Nice to report then that even tho it&#39;s hardly in the same class as &quot;Lambs,&quot; it&#39;s a willing entertainer that genuinely manages to unease.Firstly one has to get past the Hannibal Lecter factor to fully enjoy (and dampen expectations) the movie on its own terms. Lecter (Hopkins enjoying himself but going thru the motions) is a secondary character. Important? Yes! But still secondary to Norton&#39;s troubled but gifted FBI agent Will Graham and Fiennes bonkers serial killer Francis Dolarhyde (AKA:The Tooth Fairy). Red Dragon is first and foremost a ripping good old detective story, with Ratner and Tally wisely using the bits that made Harris&#39; novel such a page turning success. They have added their own bits of course {the pre-credit sequence involving Lecter &amp; Graham sets things up perfectly}, but ultimately it&#39;s a loyal enough telling of a gripping and goose flesh inducing story.The makers have wisely filled the film out with quality performers. Norton underplays Graham nicely, a character unable to stay away from the job that threatens his family, he becomes an easy guy to root for as things start to get troubling. Fiennes too doesn&#39;t go over the top, in great physical shape and with piercing blue eyes, he exudes menace without resorting to being a cackling caricature. Hoffman was a shoe in for a weasel reporter since he does it so well, while Keitel, tho not having to stretch himself, offers up a stoic turn as Jack Crawford. But the main performance, and sadly unheralded, comes from Emily Watson as the blind Reba. With Reba acting as both a romantic and redemptive foil to Dolarhyde&#39;s split-personality, Watson gets the tough gig, and comes up trumps with an affecting turn featuring the right amounts of spunk, sadness and needy tenderness.It&#39;s a bit too polished to be a nerve shredder, with Ratner unable to give the film an atmospheric feel befitting the darkness at its core. But it does deliver on the promise of not only that opening segment, but also on Harris&#39; fine procedural narrative. 7/10"
tt0367959,83. Hannibal Rising,6.1,2007,119000.0,2h 1m,R,"I don&#39;t put this in the same category
as the 3 previous films with Hopkins
(counting Manhunter out completely,,
even though it is a very good film). This movie is another animal altogether. Not
only bc this has a young actor playing a young Lecter,, but bc this is the origin story,, how he became the monster. This movie shows so many new sides to the character. A helpless child,, a traumatized teen,, a deranged young man trying to put his memories together to exact his revenge,,, and also, love. His love for the sister he lost, and also his widowed aunt.If you are a fan of the Hopkins trilogy,, then you must see this,,,"
tt0212985,84. Hannibal,6.8,2001,304000.0,2h 11m,R,"For the most part, I enjoyed this film. I was engaged throughout and that&#39;s what you want from a film. However, I found myself frustrated with some of the nonsensical choices of the characters. Hopkins was as brilliant as ever. This Hannibal was a lot more ruthless but just as cunning, perceptive and observant. I really like Julian Moore as an actress but I&#39;m just not sure she was right for this role as a shoe-in for the character of Clarice. I don&#39;t know if it was because I was comparing her to Jodie Foster&#39;s Clarice, but it just felt like two completely different characters. She wasn&#39;t as intellectual, sharp or astute as the original Clarice. She felt a lot more vulnerable than the original Clarice. And she made some questionable decisions throughout the film to say the least. Lastly, WHAT happened to the southern twang in her accent, yes your accent can change over the ten years that passed but there wasn&#39;t even a trace of it!This film overall was an interesting, further insight into Hannibal&#39;s character and also the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice, and his matured fondness for her. Overall, this film is definitely worth watching with some memorable scenes, but just don&#39;t go into it expecting it to be Silence of the lambs part 2."
tt0059113,85. Doctor Zhivago,7.9,1965,84000.0,3h 17m,Approved,"As much as I love cinema, it comes as a shock to me that I never sat down and watched this film. I was very young when it came out, my parents saw it and quite liked it, and I remember them buying the stereo record soundtrack, with details of the film and pictures of the cast, and reading it in detail. Still, the thought of sitting down and watching the whole movie, of what appeared to be cold, dark, alien Russia, was of no interest to me. However, I finally watched it a half century plus since it came out. I also read both current and contemporary critical ratings of the film, and could not be in greater disagreement with most of them.This is a great movie. It is long. It is memorable. But it is neither a soap opera nor foolish. It is not a documentary of Russia in WW1 and then going communist. It is a life and love story against a backdrop of these things. Critics should accept what a movie is about, rather than what they wish it were about.A movie like this, like all epics, gets a chance to show detail and immerse you in the environment. I never felt so chilled, and so bothered by the wind--all in my head--as during watching this film. In that way, actually feeling like you were there, has only been as realized for me in one other film, &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, where the feel of chill and desolation in that movie is pervasive.All performances are great, don&#39;t let the idiots tell you otherwise. I read that many felt the Sharif was wrong, or expressionless. Sorry, but that is his character. He is trying to be a professional physician, and keep the appropriate facade in the face of changes that are absolutely surreal. Christie possesses the kind of visual magnetism that makes the infatuation of Zhivago plausible. Rod Steiger, who is guilty of preposterous performances in other films, hits the keys of his performance so perfectly you never disbelieve him. Lesser actors would have just made him the perverted rapist that he is, but nothing more to add to the dynamics of his personality. Courtney as high-minded, full of foolishness, and in the end, blinded by frustration and I believe a touch of madness.Another thing I found splendid about this film was how it illuminated how evil, twisted, and preposterous the scheme of communism truly is. In this film, and of course in history, all the wealth of the rich is removed, and redistributed. This fixes nothing. What it does allow for, in its BS concepts that all men are the same and are all &quot;comrades&quot;, is that you don&#39;t rise due to merit, you rise because of who you know. The movie time and again shows complete idiots in charge of things...the &quot;managers&quot; of the old Zhivago house who have converted into mass housing for the jealous poor who hate Zhivago and his family. They couldn&#39;t be more useless. The leaders of various combat units. The guy who tells people on the disgusting train about the &quot;features&quot; of the accommodations. Yes, in communist countries, the cream never does rise to the top. The working class does whatever is told, just for the benefit of the scraps and their survival. Lara at one point states something like &quot;it&#39;s a horrible time to be alive&quot;....and nothing is closer to the truth than that.Again, not documentary or a wartime story, but its concepts and truths are right there.The production, of course, top notch. Watch it, take a break or two and soak it all up. It is a special kind of movie, back when they made such a thing."
tt0241527,86. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,7.7,2001,903000.0,2h 32m,PG,"Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we&#39;d get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act&#39;s Maggie Smith, James Bond 007&#39;s Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars&#39; Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!"
tt0330373,87. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,7.7,2005,716000.0,2h 37m,PG-13,"It&#39;s unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long. The rule of movie editing is when you must trim for time you remove the sub-plots. A lot of story and character development isn&#39;t there.But what is there is a great visual treat. If the movie leaves you with questions just read the book or get the audio version on CD. It would have taken a minimum of another half hour to flesh the movie out and that simply wasn&#39;t going to be done by a studio whose primary target is a younger audience. (Note how no studio wants to release an animated film longer than 90 minutes for this reason.) Perhaps Alphonso Curon would have done a better job of cohesion but there really isn&#39;t much more that could have been done in the time and the script would have been essentially the same. This movie begs for an extended Lord of the Rings type DVD, another 30 to 60 minutes to give you what was left out for theatrical release.See it and spend the bucks to see it on the big screen."
tt0295297,88. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7.4,2002,728000.0,2h 41m,PG,"I really liked the first movie, and I think I like this one more. It&#39;s certainly both darker and funnier than the first. This time though, Ron gets the most laughs(&quot;OK can we panic now?&quot;). Here we get introduced to new characters, the standout being Kenneth Branagh, a Shakespeare veteran, who stole every scene as Gildaroy Lockhart. I loved it when he said &quot;It&#39;s filthy down here,&quot; the whole cinema were in hysterics at that. Jason Isaacs was menacing too, and Dobby was hilarious with his constant head-banging. Daniel Radcliffe is audibly older here and it does work at its advantage. I thought 23 year old Christian Coulson as Riddle was very good indeed, though Riddle was much scarier in the book. Other scenes of comic relief were provided by Ron&#39;s parents, played respectably by Julie Walters and Mark Williams. However, there were still some frightening scenes, and the plot at times seemed to be convoluted. Richard Harris was surprisingly good, considering he was ailing quite visibly, and some months later he sadly died. This movie is fairly faithful to the source material, and manages to have a bit of humour too. All in all, a dark and funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
tt1392170,89. The Hunger Games,7.2,2012,1000000.0,2h 22m,PG-13,"The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins&#39; book to life. It&#39;s not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It&#39;s a film with moving drama and has its suspense.It&#39;s pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn&#39;t get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn&#39;t have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn&#39;t focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn&#39;t really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren&#39;t lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It&#39;s nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It&#39;s amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don&#39;t know what else to say about it, but it&#39;s silent, gritty, and compelling."
tt1951264,90. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7.5,2013,747000.0,2h 26m,PG-13,"I must say, I was worried about this one. Catching Fire is my favorite book of the trilogy, but cinematically it makes absolutely no sense. The Hunger Games reads like a screenplay--Catching Fire is a meandery epic full of worldbuilding and exposition for a war that won&#39;t even begin until Mockingjay. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that this installment of the hit franchise, directed by industry rookie Francis Lawrence, was maybe even more engaging than its predecessor.Visually, it is a feat. The attention to detail is remarkable. Lawrence, along with screenwriters Michael Hardt and Suzanne Collins herself, manages to weave in all of the necessary set up to the upcoming war against The Capitol without it feeling tedious or heavy-handed. The new additions to the cast, most notably Philip Seymor Hoffman&#39;s Plutarch Heavensbee and Sam Claflin&#39;s Finnick O&#39;Dair, are excellent, and the dialogue is much less wooden than, forgive me, the dialogue in the books sometimes is. Moreover, it is impressive that even with so many new people and so many moving parts, the central thread of Rebellion shines through.Of course, with so much plot, so much to set up, one can hardly blame Catching Fire for falling short in the emotional department--as is, it clocks in at 2 hours and 26 minutes--but I did find myself wanting some steamier Peeta/Katniss action. I was disappointed by Lawrence&#39;s apparent disregard for the relationship between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, no relation) and Peeta (the incomparable Josh Hutcherson). To me, Catching Fire is about Peeta. It&#39;s the Peeta show.Here&#39;s the thing: Katniss is supposed to be conflicted, not indifferent about Peeta. In the paper version, the reader, and by extension Katniss herself, feels truly torn between Gale and Peeta. She can&#39;t help but slowly fall in love with Peeta, who is so charming and funny and relentlessly Good. In this iteration, Katniss and Peeta have little to no chemistry, and Peeta only speaks when it is necessary to move the plot forward. Gale, on the other hand, is 6&#39;4 and literally a Hemsworth. That he is a Hemsworth is no one&#39;s fault, I guess, but maybe Peeta should have been allowed to say some of the cute stuff he says in the books.The &quot;adults&quot; in the cast--Woody Harrelson&#39;s Haymitch and Donald Sutherland&#39;s President Snow have much meatier roles than they do in the books. To their credit, they are fantastic. But I can&#39;t help but wonder how much more potent this movie could have been if Lawrence had trusted his young stars a bit more with the emotional heavy lifting.Though it fell a bit short of exceptional, Catching Fire is by no means a Sophomore Slump, and I look forward to watching Mockingjay Part 1 on the big screen when it comes out!"
tt1951266,91. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,6.6,2015,393000.0,2h 17m,PG-13,"I always saw The Hunger Games&#39; movies as a thrilling representation of the corruption and tyranny that&#39;s invading this world, and as a young Egyptian who lived through two recent revolutions, we know a great deal about the consequences of civil war, and how dirty the fight can be over political power. This movie hits right home with this theme in a way that democratic and luxurious societies won&#39;t understand or enjoy.Mockingjay pt2 delivers a suspenseful and emotional ride as Katniss and the other rebels set out on a mission to kill the ruthless president Snow. The film plays heavy on its politics, showing the ugly side of revolutions. It would have been easy to make a pure good vs. pure evil scenario, but the movie shows a lot of gray areas and stresses on the fact the no one is incorruptible, which is far more enjoyable in terms of storytelling.The film also does justice to its characters in their final journey, and has great performances by its two leads. J.Lawrence excels in portraying a determined Katniss fighting to subdue her tortured emotions for the sake of a bigger cause, she perfectly balances the strength of making sacrifices and becoming merciless in war without losing her humanity. Hutcherson gives his best acting shot as a confused Peeta fighting battles both on the ground and within his mind, and his monologues arrive with several meaningful moments that remind us of what &#39;The Hunger Games&#39; were all about. However, its D.Sutherland&#39;s and J.Moore&#39;s sickening performances as two similar nemeses, that elevated this young-adult film to a whole new level.But the film is anything but flawless, it has several problems which we can blame on the editing team, the slow pace of the film focuses too much on Katniss and her group that makes you forget about the outside war, and when the time came when the size of the rebellion showed itself, you don&#39;t get enough of it, which in my opinion is the biggest issue with the film. However, this was never meant to be a full scale war film, it was always, presented from one person&#39;s point of view, which is understandable. Another issue I found was in how the movie had several deaths of main characters but doesn&#39;t spend enough time to pay tribute to them, not as much as they did with Rue in the first film. Nevertheless, instead of lingering on the imperfections, I applaud Mockingjay Part 2 for the bigger message its trying to convey, for creating a satisfying resolution to one of the strongest and most enduring heroines in cinema, and for respecting its audience and not sugarcoating anything. People are complaining about this final chapter being too grim, my parents thought it was too realistic, too similar to what&#39;s happening in our country and so many others, but to me...that was necessary. I can only wish that movies like this will in some way contribute in making a wiser next generation of political leaders, which is what the film offers ultimately as consolation; a last sense of hope for the future."
tt1951265,92. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6.6,2014,524000.0,2h 3m,PG-13,"The Hunger Games story continues with the third installation, Mockingjay. And it&#39;s about as padded and needlessly long as every other two-parter we&#39;ve had since the studio executives came up with this money-grabbing monstrosity of an idea.Not to say you shouldn&#39;t see this one if you&#39;ve liked the previous Hunger Games films. This continues the story just fine. Jennifer Lawrence still shines as Katniss Everdeen. Her presence and talent hold us through even through scenes you instantly recognize as needless padding and waste of our money. The returning cast is also as talented as they&#39;ve always been and most of the new characters are also casted without hitches. Julianne Moore is perhaps a bit too... Julianne Moore to play President Coin 100 percent convincingly, but she has certain presence as well, that cannot be denied.What bugs me is the story. The book itself was the weakest of the trilogy, though not by much, and it seems that its faults bleed into the film. Especially because the iron tight pace of the previous installations is thrown straight out of the window and we spent most of our time building up atmosphere. And building. And building. And... You get the point. There&#39;s very little bang for your buck here and even when something substantial happens, it simply lacks that edge.Plus, they had the perfect closing scene, and for some reason they decided to keep going for about five minutes. Trust me, you know where they should have ended it when you&#39;ve seen the movie.This is a good movie. It still looks great, the main actors are brilliant and it has enough depth to impress through its story alone. I just wish they had had the integrity to go with one movie. It very well might have been the best Hunger Games movie of the three. It would have had two movies before it to build up momentum and steam. Instead it lifts up the pedal from the gas and decides to stroll over the finish line. Poor form, extremely poor form."

Sure, if it was released say, in 1970, when none of the superhero/sci-fi/fantasy that today is flooding the audiences was present, it would have been quite enjoyable and watchable.
But in today&#39;s market it brings nothing new. I could constantly guess what was going to happen at the end of certain action scenes, and don&#39;t even get me started about the helicopter scene... that one was supposed to be dramatic and some kind of fitting twist but just left me enraged at the stupidity of the screenwriters/adaptation.In the end it&#39;s quality is on par with the other 2 similar series (Divergent and Hunger Games), so, gets a 5 star &quot;meh&quot; out of me. Good for kids but intelligent people beware!"

I went into the movie &quot;cold&quot;, not having read the novel by James Dashner or knowing very much about the plot. For me, this was the type of film that I knew if I just went with the flow and didn&#39;t try and look for all the holes in the story and script that I&#39;d be better off.The way the film was presented by first time director Wes Ball was top notch, as I felt I was right there in the maze with the main characters. The obvious set-up for a sequel at the end of the movie didn&#39;t bother me too much as it seems like every movie of this type &quot;has to&quot; have at least one.In summary, I found this movie to be very absorbing and kept my interest throughout."

tt1099212,96. Twilight,5.3,2008,506000.0,2h 2m,PG-13,"That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would&#39;ve just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I&#39;m not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson&#39;s baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it&#39;s kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn&#39;t expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn&#39;t aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he&#39;s immortal. But he doesn&#39;t have fangs, and he doesn&#39;t drink human blood.So, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it&#39;s average, it&#39;s my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I&#39;m a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn&#39;t take their &quot;love&quot; seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward&#39;s father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you&#39;re a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matinée price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.5/10"
tt1673434,97. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,5.6,2012,272000.0,1h 55m,PG-13,"&#39;The Twilight Saga&#39; comes to an end in possibly the most subversively underwhelming way. However, you can&#39;t really hold it against this franchise for at least being very consistent with its quality.This movie is treating its moments of culmination as if it&#39;s been highly anticipated when, in actuality, the series has not been building up to the conclusion it reaches, which only happens due to a misunderstanding that&#39;s slowly resolved. The CGI baby is freaky, distracting, and just so perplexing that it&#39;s best left ignored. Bella apparently has a brain now, and with it a problem with Jacob imprinting on, and therefore protecting, her baby, as she&#39;s constantly leaving it in anyone else&#39;s protection other than her own. Edward has lost all of his appeal at this point, being left as one of the least compelling characters in this instalment. Carlisle, Alice and Charlie are my personal stand-outs, and are each noticeably absent or sidelined in favour of newer, more uninteresting characters. Michael Sheen&#39;s presence is felt more here than in maybe any other instalment, but still so brief that he&#39;s hardly all that interesting even though he&#39;s supposedly the primary overarching antagonist. The effects, score and camera work are on par with the previous films, which isn&#39;t saying much but there&#39;s not much else to say.A suitable end to an overly broody, dramatic franchise, with improved acting compared to the other films, and a resolution that just let&#39;s you know it&#39;s all over now."
tt1324999,98. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,4.9,2011,263000.0,1h 57m,PG-13,"I am neither a Twilight fan or a Twilight detractor. This said, I am indifferent to the franchise. As far as the movies, I still think, coming from someone whose knowledge of the books only comes from my sister being a fan and me reading a chapter of one and putting it down, that the best is Eclipse(not saying much) and New Moon the worst. But that is not a consolation really. Breaking Dawn: Part 1 is not quite among the worst of the year and nowhere near among the worst ever, however it suffers from some major problems that I will get to later in the review. So what was it that got me seeing Breaking Dawn: Part 1 in the first place? The answer was its director, Bill Condon. I am familiar with his previous films and find him a promising director and writer, finding his films well written, observed and acted. Gods and Monsters is amazing and one of my favourites, Kinsey was interesting and Dreamgirls elevated by the soundtrack and cast was quite decent. Did Condon do a good job directing? For me, I am not sure. I&#39;d say of the four Twilight movies so far Breaking Dawn: Part 1 has the most cinematic feel to it, on the other hand there is not much here that made Condon&#39;s previous films so good and I&#39;d go as far to say it is the film of his that engaged me the least.Are there any redeeming qualities to this instalment? I think so actually. Although there are moments of sloppy editing, I did like the look of the film. At some points it was quite Gothic, and at others it had either an evergreen or autumnal feel to it. The scenery often does look stunning, the effects are okay I guess and the cinematography especially with the close-ups of the back of the wedding dress and the final shot is some of the best of the franchise in my opinion.I also liked Carter Burwell&#39;s score. I like Burwell a lot, his music has a hypnotic and quite hauntingly beautiful quality to it. For my tastes though some of the pop tunes are on the insipid side, however the score itself was pleasant with a lot of what I like about Burwell evident.Much has been said about the sex scene. In all honesty I was expecting it to be of hilariously cheesy quality, but somehow Condon brought a little more subtlety than I was expecting. The last thirty minutes was perhaps the most exciting Breaking Dawn: Part 1 got, as some of does have purpose and intensity, which was something that the first half of the film did not have.There are also two good performances, Billy Burke and Michael Sheen, the latter being another point of interest. Burke as always is amusing with some of the better lines of the film(though is that saying much do you think?), while Sheen, ever the great actor, adopts a menace and magnetism as Aro without overdoing it too much. Ashley Greene is also quite good, if not great.I have to say I still don&#39;t think much of the acting of the central trio. Kristen Stewart is much better than she is in New Moon, with much less of the moping and dead pauses, but some of her line delivery is still awkward and her facial expressions for my tastes are lifeless. It doesn&#39;t help though that Bella is a rather dull character.Robert Pattinson has more to do than he did in New Moon and is less hammy than in the first film(the looking into the camera moments brought moments of unintentional laughter when I first went to see Twilight when it came out). As a matter of fact this is perhaps his best performance of the series and he is certainly the best of the central trio, but like Stewart some of the line delivery could&#39;ve been more inspired.Taylor Lautner on the other hand is getting worse and worse. He is hunky to be sure, but does that alone make you a good actor? Not to me. I will give credit and say he is better than he was in this year&#39;s Abduction, where both the film and performance were awful, but the more dramatic moments from him felt forced and overplayed, and throughout there was a very stilted nature about him. A lot of the problem is to do with the writing. The dialogue in the Twilight franchise never was particularly good, saying this though in terms of written quality this is Twilight at its most banal, its most clunky and its most cheesy. The characters are clichéd and underdeveloped too, and at the end of the day you don&#39;t care for anybody. Oh, and the talking wolves were poorly done and unintentionally funny.The story is very bland and unengaging, not to mention thin structurally and in content. The whole of the first half reads little more than ponderous melodrama. Was the wedding lavish? Yes it was. But it was also plodding and over-extended. The second half fares better, still with the clunky dialogue, uneven acting and cheesy, underdeveloped plot points and characterisations, but as I said the last thirty minutes or so serves as the highlight of the film. But for me what killed the film was the pace. Mind you, I have seen movies with slow pacing, but they are often paced deliberately and with strong meanings, great acting and dialogue and identifiable characters. With little of that here, Breaking Dawn: Part 1 not only is dull and plodding but also uninteresting and without bite.Overall, despite my admiration for Condon and Sheen, this didn&#39;t work. The ending is highly suggestive of a continuation, which I understand is happening. If so, I do hope it will be better than this. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
tt1259571,99. The Twilight Saga: New Moon,4.8,2009,310000.0,2h 10m,PG-13,"Okay here it is, New Moon is not unwatchable (thought some parts come close). Twilight was a bit better mostly cause it had some direction. This one is severely unfocused, with a plot that denies motivation and has lazy acting across the board...well not quite.New Moon may have one edge over its predecessor which is that Taylor Launter puts more into the game than Rob Pattinson. At times, it feels like Jacob may be the better match for Bella. Their interaction which takes up the majority of the movie in fact, feels less broody than the Bella/Edward connection. Unfotunately, around the beginning of the third act we grow out of Jacob almost as fast as we grow into him. Wheras Edward is quite blatantly shy, Jacob by contrast is angry. The reasons for this however seem largely unjustified by the story. Like all bad stories, this one advances by making up its own rules on the spot, resulting in a movie that makes very little sense.I&#39;m truly not sure what it is about the Twilight saga that demands such a plastic style of acting. Why is everyone so lazy about this? it actually degrades the quality of the material. If this is the kind of Romantic chemistry that sells on the market (a chemistry where two people act like kissing is more pain than pleasure) then Romance itself could be a dying genre.But perhaps that is an overstatement. New Moon gave me something to watch on TV when there was nothing else on, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for any other purpose."
tt1325004,100. The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,5.1,2010,270000.0,2h 4m,PG-13,"It&#39;s been billed as the biggest film of the year and perhaps it will be, but it has some stiff competition from the likes of Harry Potter coming this winter, so let&#39;s see if Eclipse really deserves that prestigious title.The vampire and werewolf love saga has been bitterly disappointing so far with a dull first instalment and a hideously depressing second. Add to this some excruciatingly painful running times of over two hours and you have death by celluloid.But perhaps I&#39;m being a little unfair; this third instalment has been based on perhaps the most exciting book of the four in the series so it already has a good starting point and some convincing performances from the actors really do make this film a huge leap ahead of what preceded it.The storyline to this film is pretty much non-existent but director David Slade does a good job of turning zilch into another depressing, but well made two hour love fest. Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen), Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) and Taylor Lautner (Jacob) return as the three main leads and their love triangle becomes even more confusing this time around, with frowning faces and awkward kisses galore. Add to this an army of newborn vampires ready to rip the very flesh of Bella Swan&#39;s bones and it&#39;s getting pretty tense down in Forks.Sadly, even with a whole army of vampires and werewolves fighting in the finale, this small increase in action doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that the film drags in more than one place with blocks of dialogue that feel as if they&#39;re going to last a lifetime. It&#39;s unfortunate as the action pieces look excellent and the CGI, especially in the werewolves has improved leaps and bounds between New Moon and Eclipse. This shamefully vain dialogue with unnecessary close-ups of Robert Pattinson&#39;s face, Kristen Stewart&#39;s eyelashes and Taylor Lautner&#39;s chest are surely there just to appeal to the female fans and do nothing to progress the story.It is these main three characters that hinder the film; their stilted dialogue and mediocre acting overshadow the rest of the cast who are all superb. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard playing red head vampire Victoria is seriously underused along with the whole Cullen flock who are not given enough room to breathe between the heavy central dialogue. Their acting is fantastic, why not use them more? Thankfully, it isn&#39;t all tears before bedtime with some well-timed comic humour from Bella&#39;s dad, Charlie. Played by Billy Burke, he is the only character of the used variety that leaps off the screen and he does so well, playing to his strengths as an actor.Overall, Eclipse moves the game on but only very slowly. David Slade has crafted a beautifully shot movie with some excellent action pieces; but it still remains dull as ditch water because of bland performances from the lead cast and chunky dialogue. It&#39;s bound to please fans but biggest film of the year? I think we&#39;ll be seeing a certain boy wizard holding that honour for 2010."
tt0112641,101. Casino,8.2,1995,591000.0,2h 58m,R,"I generally avoid violent films...which is why I resisted watching &quot;Casino&quot; for a long time. However, despite being very violent in spots, the film turned out to be very compelling....it was far more than just violence and had an interesting look at the mob influence in Las Vegas back in the day.The film is unusual in that it has two leading men with parallel stories. Sometimes Ace and Nicky (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) were in scenes together....often they were apart...each doing his own thing. As for Ace, he was a smart man who was in charge of one of Vegas&#39; top casinos. He was tough...but basically honest for a mobster. As for Nicky, as you&#39;d expect with a Joe Pesci character, he&#39;s a bit of a nut-job....often out of control and letting anger govern most of his decisions. Unlike Ace who had a veneer of honesty about him, Nicky was a hood...and didn&#39;t mind this. Eventually, the pair end up having a downfall. How and what happens to each you&#39;ll have to see for yourself.The parts of this film I enjoyed the most were when you learned about how Vegas operated. Seeing Ace dealing with crooked gamblers was especially interesting. And, in this sense, I enjoyed the film much more than &quot;Goodfellas&quot;...also with the same stars and same director. This is because &quot;Goodfellas&quot; was mostly just about violence and crime...whereas &quot;Casino&quot; seemed to have more story and wasn&#39;t always about excessive violence and nastiness...not that the film is in any way a &#39;nice&#39; picture. It&#39;s filled with obscenities, nasty folks and a few scenes of horrific violence. Think about this before you decide whether or not to see the movie.By the way, this is only a personal choice and doesn&#39;t really affect the movie much, but one thing I did not love about the film is the omnipresent pop music....which at times made the film seem like a music video. I think less of this would have been nice."
tt0113627,102. Leaving Las Vegas,7.5,1995,140000.0,1h 51m,R,"Ben Sanderson is an alcoholic, who after getting released from his well paid screen writing position, heads to Vegas with his severance pay. Where he seriously plans to drink himself to death. But whilst cruising down the strip he meets Sera, a nicely turned out prostitute, and both troubled souls come together in an unlikely romance. Based around the semi-autobiographical novel by John O&#39;Brien, an alcoholic who committed suicide before the film made it to the screen, this is a sad, dark and deeply upsetting picture. Sanderson and his plight has no motive, we are not fed reasons for his nihilistic behaviour. We find him at the beginning of the film joyously hurtling thru a liquor market isle, promptly filling his shopping cart with bottles of liquor. From here on in we know that this is no ordinary film about an alcoholic trying to get off the booze, we are on a train to Bleakville, stops at Love and Liberation seem a very long way away. Enter Sera, the sweet and wholesome prostitute, who having escaped the abusive and borderline psycho pimp, Yuri, is herself in need of liberation. But can she carry the burden of both as this unlikely and almost certainly doomed romance starts to become significant? Nicholas Cage as Sanderson is terrific, very compelling, realistic and segueing from zany wired comedy to the desolation of Sanderson&#39;s death wish descent within a heart beat. Elisabeth Shue as Sera is also incredibly potent, if perhaps guilty of looking too pristine, and prompting questions of why she would be drawn to Ben&#39;s world anyway? Shue none the less works her socks off to make Sera sensitive and believable. Directed by Mike Figgis, who shot it beautifully in Super 16 film, the film won a Best Actor Academy Award for Cage, and garnered nominations for Best Actress {Shue} &amp; Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay {both Figgis}. Massively popular and praised on release, it has lost none of the impact that it had back then. 8/10"

This one is a drop for payments in a booking racket, and the bar owner (James Gandolfini) sort of goes along because he has no choice. The bartender (Tom Hardy) is far more ambiguous, and he makes the movie click. Add Noomi Rapace whose small role fills in a big gap rather well and you have the core of the cast, all excellent.There is no attempt at the grandiose here, despite all the history and slightly exaggerated characters involved (mostly bad ones). And that&#39;s the beauty of the movie, which manages not just realism but a welcome tenderness amidst all the darkness and bad intentions. The one bright spot is, tragically, Gandolfini, who manages to be really funny even as he about to do terrible things. Hardy is just the opposite, showing a huge heart with utter sobriety even as he, too, is going to do terrible things.Whether this quite rises above the many movies that dive into this kind of world I don&#39;t know, but I thoroughly enjoyed it even when it seemed to get slow. It doesn&#39;t plod, but it has no urgency, either. There are some clichés that might have been avoided (the attitude of the bad guys) and some violence that seemed a bit in your face, but it balances out, too. Rapace is not given enough to do—this is a man&#39;s movie, another one —but she is tough and smart in necessary ways. Well filmed, smartly done, I&#39;d give this a look."

Yet, despite loving the original, I wasn&#39;t going into this one ready to bitch about it. I am someone who is very sniffy about remakes, but hey if you have an fascinating premise that can be explored through various styles and dynamics I am all for it. Especially in this case, I think that keeping some of the core material and turning other parts completely around could have made for a fascinating narrative, unfortunately the American remake, with the exception of maybe two or three ides, doesn&#39;t improve, explore or further the original in anyway and sometimes even edges the shot-by-shot remake treatment.Look, this isn&#39;t a terrible thriller, but the emotional beats you are carried through are just the same of the original, it really seemed to be watching a cheap version of it. It is way too reminiscent of the original and at some moments I really felt exactly when I saw it. Whilst at other moments I kind of felt sorry for the remake because it doesn&#39;t manage to replicate some of the amazing photography the first one had and actually miserably fails: this film has some really, noticeably cheap cinematography and editing.The performances are all kind of off beat. Julia Roberts is definitely the best one, even though she also has some low points. The rest of the cast is just flat honestly. Nobody even tries to come in and give it some palpable passion. The film is also inconsistent with tone and I am not sure they understood the fascination of the original because a lot of the focus points are just sidelined or shoehorned in.That&#39;s also a real bummer, because the film does have just a couple of good ideas that aren&#39;t simply built on. They tread too much of the same ground and do it in a way that is simply too familiar. I can maybe think of one thing that was improved upon and that is mainly thanks to Julia Roberts&#39; talent. The score is something that positively sticks out and probably the purest good thing to come out of the film.In the end we are treated to a fine thriller that doesn&#39;t live up to its potential and only manages to justify its length thanks to memories of the original and the same emotions instead of relevant improvement and originality."

As a fan of the book, let me just say that&#39;s true but it&#39;s fine. The overarching story is the same. The fact of the matter is with a nearly 400 page novel packed full of pop culture references, some things would have to be cut to make it onto the big screen. Partially it&#39;s an issue of length. Partially it&#39;s just the reality that the planets were never going to fully align to allow use of many of the properties from the novel. Yes, I loved the 2112, WarGames, D&amp;D, Joust, et al references from the novel as much as the next person, but still I felt that Spielberg captured the wonder and fun and the story of the novel accurately, even if he did so using different references. The are actually some things I even think were an improvement from the book, especially the way they re-imagined I-R0k. The bottom line is, if you&#39;re a book reader, just take this movie for what it is, an alternate version of the story, written by the same person who wrote the novel."
tt0758758,108. Into the Wild,8.0,2007,679000.0,2h 28m,R,"Sean Penn&#39;s new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless&#39;s parents, because he doesn&#39;t want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.Emile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minuteswith Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no licenseand it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.Hirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn&#39;t that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I&#39;m even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God."

A visual masterpiece, and an intoxicating story of belief and friendship.You must give so much credit to the team that produced this, not a book I would have thought easy to adapt, as it is so vague, the realisation is of course breathtaking, I absolutely loved it.I&#39;ve read comments about those that wanted action and dramatic scenes, this film isn&#39;t about the destination, it&#39;s about the journey.Breathtaking, 9/10."
tt0878804,110. The Blind Side,7.6,2009,374000.0,2h 9m,PG-13,"I&#39;ve been reading lot of horrible comments that are based solely on the issues surrounding the movie rather than the movie itself. I wasn&#39;t excited to see this movie, I&#39;m not interested in sports at all. The movie kept my attention though and well. It moved along quickly and pulled me into the story and left me feeling inspired. I wasn&#39;t excited to see a blonde sandy bullock in a sports movie, I think that&#39;s what might have turned me off the most, but she did really good job! It&#39;s rare to see a movie where there&#39;s a really strong lead female character. Whether you like Leigh Anne Touhy or not in the end, she is certainly entertaining and Sandra Bullock does a great job of bringing her onto the screen. The youngest son did an amazing job! So much talent in him. The character of Mike I think could have used a few more lines, even if he&#39;s supposed to be shy and reserved. All the actors really did a great job though for the most part. No it&#39;s not an epic Oscar winning film, although I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Bullock got nominated for something for her acting. It is NOT loaded with propaganda as the other reviews might suggest. It&#39;s a light entertaining pick me up film that would be an excellent choice to bring the family to, most likely the reason why they released it over the Holidays."
tt0289879,111. The Butterfly Effect,7.6,2004,540000.0,1h 53m,R,"Every so often we all seem to move away from the usual nothings we talk about amongst our friends, and instead get into a deeply philosophical conversation about the workings of Chaos Theory and the existence of parallel universes. No? Okay, just me then. In any case, this discussion just the other day led to a friend recommending The Butterfly Effect, a film that puts both a stylistic and sinister spin on the idea that even the mere flapping of a butterfly&#39;s wings can result in drastic changes in another place or time. Being initially sceptical because of the generally negative reaction from critics, I was certainly not disappointed by film&#39;s end.Ashton Kutcher couldn&#39;t be more different that his concurrent role as the dimwitted Kelso from That &#39;70s Show in his lead performance as Evan Treborn, a man who has suffered blackouts since his childhood, and realises that he can access and relive vital gaps in his memory through the help of other sources like journals or images. He uses this skill to, in his eyes, right the wrongs of the past. Namely, injustices that were performed upon his friends Lenny and Tommy and only love Kayleigh (Amy Smart). What he doesn&#39;t realise is that the changes he thinks are made for the better actually result in a severely changed future that threatens his own life.Without trying to sound like a sadist, The Butterfly Effect excels in presenting a consistently dark, melancholy atmosphere. Indeed, there is hardly a happy moment in the entire film, although that may be untrue depending on which ending you watch (more on that later). Any event that looks as if it might provide a slim ray of hope for Evan to make things right is quickly dashed by a sudden escalation of the plot, maintaining the viewer&#39;s interest the whole way through. The film doesn&#39;t shy away from heavy subject matter either, including prostitution, murder, paedophilia and drug use, all of which culminates in an enjoyably gritty, underground tone.Positively, the menacing nature of the movie isn&#39;t weighed down by comic relief. I suppose when many of us think of this sort of plot, we first think of the Simpsons Halloween special when Homer invents the time-travelling toaster. Not knowing quite how dark the film would turn out to be, I was concerned The Butterfly Effect would go down a similar path, in which Evan keeps returning to the present to find that all humans have grown wings or Pauly D has become President. Instead, any changes are limited to the persona of the characters, rather than altering the physical environment, which was definitely the professional path to take.The pacing is another strength. For a film that comes in well under two hours, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber deserve credit for packing a lot in, and doing it well. Certainly, some thrillers benefit from slow-moving scenes to draw suspense (the superb Eyes Wide Shut, for example) but Butterfly manages to combine compounding urgency with engaging character development in constructing a fast-moving film that requires both thought and stamina to decipher, without being needlessly confusing.Oddly, the film possesses four different final scenes, and so the lasting message of the movie may differ depending on the copy viewed. My favourite ending is the &#39;official&#39; one applied to the theatrical release. It is satisfying, yet open-ended, as is the case with its alternate cut. Another is uncharacteristically upbeat and illogical, perhaps suggested in the editing room as a way of appeasing confused screen-test viewers. But if you really want to get down to brass tax, go with the Director&#39;s Cut: a far more morbid conclusion with a surreal twist. Intrigued? Don&#39;t let me stop you.*There&#39;s nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"
tt0172493,"112. Girl, Interrupted",7.3,1999,224000.0,2h 7m,R,"I found this film browsing through Netflix&#39;s deplorable movie catalogue, and couldn&#39;t figure out when did I watched it some time ago. Utterly enjoyable all the way through, I was delighted by Angelina Jolie&#39;s performance, I hadn&#39;t even remembered she won an Oscar for it, it wasn&#39;t until near the end that it hit me. Her performance is truly astounding, she composes her character with traits that perfectly define a person with her mental state. Her mannerisms, her volatile and somewhat unpredictable self makes her a bit frightening, which makes the viewer watch her performance uncomfortable and in awe at the same time.Winona Ryder is great as well, she portrays her different condition in a different manner as expected, perhaps more discreetly, but still effective nonetheless. Overall, most acting performances are on point, such as Clea DuVall, the late Brittany Murphy, Whoopi Goldberg and Elisabeth Moss, they all deserved to be credited.If you want well-done drama with splendid performances, look no further, and enjoy yourself. Especially Angelina Jolie&#39;s phenomenal Oscar-winning performance."
tt1045658,113. Silver Linings Playbook,7.7,2012,759000.0,2h 2m,R,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a &quot;hey this is a great flick&quot; way but in a derogatory, judgmental &quot;you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)&quot; way. I get it. It&#39;s about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I&#39;ll watch it just to say I did.But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it&#39;s about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn&#39;t seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black &amp; white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here&#39;s the fun part. &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot; is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as &quot;crazy&quot; and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you&#39;d see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it&#39;s subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters&#39; words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don&#39;t expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.Also, even though I described this as a &quot;romcom&quot;, it&#39;s really not a romance or a comedy. It&#39;s more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That&#39;s all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I&#39;ll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the &quot;town slut&quot; (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.It&#39;s a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it&#39;s not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won&#39;t want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there&#39;s a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time."
tt0112573,114. Braveheart,8.3,1995,1100000.0,2h 58m,R,"My old dad used to treat this Mel Gibson Best Picture Oscar-winner with utter scorn and derision, especially with reference to the actual facts as known. He always started off with the respective differences in size between the real William Wallace&#39;s true dimensions and the much less imposing Mel Gibson while anyone who does the mildest of diligence into the historical facts will see just how much licence director Gibson and his screenwriter Randall Wallace took with the Scottish rebel-hero&#39;s story. I know and knew all this even as I rewatched the film again but despite the overwhelming number of plot contrivances served up, I have to admit as an independence-leaning Scot myself, the film never fails to stir my own blood.We follow the young Wallace from his early childhood, almost literally blooded early in life to hate the occupying English army under the rule of their despotic King Edward Longshanks played with real brio by Patrick McGoohan. When he loses his father and older brother in another betrayal by Edward, it&#39;s clear that the now fully-grown, long-haired Wallace is only awaiting one final provocation before he accepts the freedom-fighter mantle and takes up the cudgels on behalf of his downtrodden people.For those who don&#39;t know very much about Scottish history, it is filled with glorious failures and almost as often double-dealing, back-stabbing intrigue so that it&#39;s no surprise when his heroics are brought to an end by a combination of underhand scheming on the part of Edward and the connivance of the corruptible Scottish nobility, in particular the treachery of the future &quot;try, try again&quot; hero - King Robert the Bruce. But Wallace has the last word in more ways than one with his martyr&#39;s death and impregnation of the future English queen.Certainly one of Hollywood&#39;s more outrageous retellings of a story from history, the movie bludgeons its way into the viewer&#39;s consciousness down to the twin combination of Gibson&#39;s muscular, gritty direction and his athleticism and conviction in the lead role. Sure, the accents across the cast are occasionally as convincing as a King&#39;s promise, but with effective use of crowd scenes and the gory, no holds-barred depictions of battleground warfare, laced with earthy humour and even a good old Highland romance, Gibson delivers a powerfully uplifting if historically inaccurate feature which has thrilled the Scottish national psyche and no doubt the freedom-seeking aspirations of many another country ever since."
tt0120669,115. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,7.5,1998,310000.0,1h 58m,R,"Where to even start with this? What starts as a fun drug-fueled comedy slowly turns into a claustrophobic nightmare of grotesque imagery and sensory overload. I&#39;ve never done any hallucinogetic drugs, but I imagine that after a while, the rush Would become a nightmare. This is an ugly movie. It&#39;s hard to watch. It&#39;s extremely uncfomfortable. And that&#39;s the point.Terry Gilliam said in his own words: &quot;I want it to be seen as one of the great movies of all time, and one of the most hated movies of all time.&quot; Judging by the critics&#39; reactions, he succeded.
The film has an almost perfectly split 50 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, and many critics, including Roger Ebert, were completely appalled by it, and honestly, it&#39;s not hard to see why.But the movie survived. It has stood the test of time. It has risen from the ashes to become stronger than ever before. It is a paradox. A joyful nightmare. A horrifying treat.

Marcus did the song &quot; killing me softly &quot; because it was one of his mums favorites and even though the audience was banal and cruel he still had the gumption and heart to get up there an perform for his mom. life isn&#39;t about trying to fit in and be with the cool crowd, there&#39;s so much more important things in life then that and Marcus was mature enough to understand that, with help from Will of course. well, i won&#39;t give anything else away about this movie, but if you&#39;re looking for a intelligent, heartwarming, tender, sad and funny movie, this is it. i would recommend this movie to just about anybody over the age of 10. this is one of those hidden little gems that has also a very strong positive message about what is right and what is wrong. there was not one dull moment in this movie and i think i must&#39;ve chuckle or guffawed about 50 times during the duration of this movie and it&#39;s not a long movie.if you like intelligent tender heartwarming comedic movies where all the actors and actresses were in top form...then you have to watch this movie. one of my favorite comedies all-time."

The visuals are something you will remember, the acting is superb, the cast (the kids as the young students and the older kids), the horror of &quot;the secret&quot; and then the unveiling of the reason for &quot;hope&quot; they cling to. One of the best reasons to see this movie is that you will need to think about topics you have not ever grappled with before. Your memories and opinions of this movie should be haunting and unforgettable. It is not a happily-ever-after film and is quiet, slow, and deep. The music is wonderful.

I&#39;m really particular when it comes to people just bursting out into song for no apparent reason and this was one of those few times where I actually liked it. I&#39;ve always enjoyed the Don Quixote story and this was a fantastic turnaround. I can see why some viewers say that the singing wasn&#39;t nearly as extraordinary as it was on Broadway but few film adaptations are. Besides the acting was stellar and it drew out extreme emotions of happiness, sorrow, or laughter out of me at times. Though dirty and ragged I found Sophia Lauren to still be beautiful and her body is absolutely perfect in every way I can fathom. Peter O&#39;Toole was great as a crazy old man set forth on an unattainable quest for glory and at the end someone who had to once again face the harsh life of reality. For those of us who haven&#39;t seen it on the stage I feel it is a wonderful performance that was thoroughly enjoyable for persons of all ages that are looking to be whisked away by a tiny bit of magic!

Inspector Leo Caldas (Carmelo Gómez) along with his assistant (Antonio Garrido) will be in charge of investigating the death of the sailor. A shipwreck !. No one speaks !. A mystery to solve !.Director Gerardo Herrero presents this film in a very stylish and straight-forward way. This is a good suspense movie with adequate scenarios and dealing with an offbeat, surprising murder that leads to twisted consequences. It is an acceptable and decent film about two cops looking for a mysterious murderer, though copying here and there the typical American thrillers and even the CSI investigation .The movie is exhilarating in its visual approach , including thrills , chills , intrigue , plot twists , and spectacular visual spectacle. Director Gerardo Herrero adapts to the big screen the novel ¨A praia dos afogados¨ (La playa de los ahogados), the second novel by the Galician writer Domingo Villar. The novel, like Villar&#39;s first book (Ojos de agua) is starred by Inspector Leo Caldas, a withdrawn and solitary Galician policeman. The film is shot in a remarkably simple and direct fashion, which keeps the script and roles clear, but sacrifices at times a lot of opportunities for a more innovative treatment. The person in charge of giving life to Caldos is the already veteran actor Carmelo Gómez as the local detective sets out to resolve the case. Leo Caldas is a calm and methodical police detective, with a clear level of serenity and patience that enables his investigation to take priority over any significant back story or character flaws. He is accompanied by Antonio Garrido in the role of sub-inspector Rafael Estévez, the tough assistant of the inspector who does not stop at anything and uses more coercive and even violent means. Rafael is an Aragonese who does not understand Galicia or the Galicians. He is the physical, aggressive off-sider to Caldas&#39; thoughtful protagonist, growing angry while Caldas remains calm and applying force where Caldas would prefer to hold back. Garrido plays the part acceptably, but he does seem too much of a stereotype. Starring alongside them in this police thriller are Luis Zahera who seems terrific, playing one of the key suspects in a multi-layered fashion that provides a good amount of extra nuance; as well as Celso Bugallo, Pedro Alonso, Fernando Morán, Marta Larralde, Tamar Novas, María Vázquez, and Celia Freijeiro, most of whom are Galician actors.The Galician landscape and coastal towns present opportunities for an attractively framed and colorful film, including gorgeous exteriors, atmospherically photographed from Nigrán, Pontevedra, Galicia. Adding an evocative as well as intriguing musical score by expert composer Lucio Godoy. Gerardo Herrero was President of the Spanish Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (1994-1994) . Great producer of big hits, being especially known for ¨The Secret of your ears¨ (2009), ¨Sin Retorno¨ (2010) , ¨Balada Triste de Trompeta¨ (2010), ¨Crimenes De Oxford¨ (2008) and¨ El Hijo De La Novia¨ (2001). He also directed some good films, such as: ¨Silencio En Nieve¨ , ¨Corredor Nocturno¨ , ¨Principio Arquímedes¨, ¨Crimen Galindez¨ , ¨Frontera Sur¨, ¨Territorio Comanche¨, ¨Desvio a Paraíso¨ , ¨Al Acecho¨ , ¨Heroína¨, ¨Bajo terapia¨ and many others.

Age-old cliché that Marie-Antoinette was nothing more than a self-absorbed bimbo?

Again, the tried-and-true representation of 18th century French aristocrats as clueless morons? Check.So, after reinstating the same backdrop again (and again), this version puts forth a bigger focus on rumours of a lesbian love affair the queen was accused of having back then, because that would make the movie so unique.. or not.

Well I hate to break it to you but 12 years later, all of these things are not only still true but probably even worse with dating apps. There is a solid cast in this movie and I found the writing and directing to be very decent for a rom com. It&#39;s a movie so of course there&#39;s a bit of dramatization (do you think all cops act like John McLane?) but for the most part the storylines are interesting and pretty representative of their situation. Overall I found it cute and entertaining."

tt3859076,129. Truth,6.8,2015,22000.0,2h 5m,R,"Powerful non-fiction drama about the modern-age tactic of tearing apart someone else&#39;s news story for fear of its validity--or rather, finding a vulnerable link in that story and attacking it, dissecting it in the public eye, until nobody remembers anymore what the point of the actual story was supposed to be, only that a flaw was found and therefore it&#39;s a crock. Cate Blanchett is excellent as &quot;60 Minutes&quot; producer Mary Mapes who, just prior to the 2004 presidential election, thought she found a tasty piece for the television news program on CBS: questioning whether President George W. Bush received preferential treatment during his time in the military. With hard evidence in the form of letters and documents that Bush did skate by (going AWOL for one year), Mapes and her team beat a five-day clock to produce the story news-anchor Dan Rather (Robert Redford) reported on the air. All appears to be fine after the segment airs, but when pro-Bush camps go after the accuracy of the documents--perhaps smelling a liberal bias--Rather, Mapes and her crew are all called on the carpet by nervous network executives. An investigation of journalism, of television news and its ethics, of politics in the business of TV news and the internal workings of breaking a story about a story all come to the fore here, in generally grand fashion. Redford, initially, seems a curious choice for Rather; he looks nothing like the legendary television personality, though he does have Rather&#39;s cadence down and you come to believe in the performance. Blanchett and her support, Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Elisabeth Moss, are all terrific. Director James Vanderbilt, who also co-produced and adapted Mapes&#39; book, &quot;Truth and Duty: The Press, the President and the Privilege of Power&quot;, does fluid, engrossing work. While the theatrical film faded fast at the box office, it plays very strongly on cable or home video. This might have been the perfect HBO event movie, the intimate medium of television a better fit for the material. *** from ****"
tt1605777,130. The Woman in the Fifth,5.3,2011,7300.0,1h 24m,R,"&quot;The Woman in the Fifth&quot; throws us into the middle of the story. Seemingly a perfect way to start, a back-story is implied begging to be told, and future events destined to unfold to eventually come together in an interesting climax and dénouement. But the back-story never was revealed and the plot elements are indiscernible to the average eye.Tom (Ethan Hawke) is an American writer moving to Paris. His first novel was a moderate success and he is most likely suffering from various creative blocks, probably not helped by the fact that his ex-wife has a restraining order against him, prohibiting him from seeing his daughter. At this point, we are driven into a world of crime – not surprising for a thriller, but we don&#39;t know what crimes yet. Broke and alone, Tom makes a deal with a shady &quot;businessman&quot;, develops an affair with a mysterious worldly woman (Kristin Scott Thomas) and then develops an affair with a sweetly mysterious waitress (Joanna Kulig).For the few crimes that we do know were committed, it&#39;s awfully hard to understand why or by whom. The reality of the film and the imagination (or fantasy) element of the film are most likely impossible to separate. Almost all viewers have come up with different explanations, if they came up with any.It can be interesting watching a jarring film and deduce whatever explanation you like. It can also be disappointing if you don&#39;t come up with any explanation that you like. I&#39;m afraid I fall into the latter group.That being said, it&#39;s nice seeing Ethan Hawke in a lead role in an indie. And speaking French no less (not perfectly, but it fits the role)! The imagery and cinematography chosen for this film were interesting and walked the thin line between thriller and horror, helped along with a slightly off-beat score. &quot;The Woman in the Fifth&quot; is off- beat, if it&#39;s anything at all."
tt3741834,131. Lion,8.0,2016,259000.0,1h 58m,PG-13,"Do you know the feeling you get when you go into a film with no expectations at all or thinking it might be decent, and the film turns out to not only be good, but blows you away by how amazing it ends up being? That&#39;s LION, and if you&#39;ve been watching films for several years like me thinking you&#39;ve seen everything committed to cinema, it&#39;s a fantastic feeling to be proved wrong.Let me explain to you exactly what I experienced while watching LION: Almost half of the film is in Hindi, which lends incredible authenticity to the story, not that BS where they have actors in which English is their second language speak English for the sake of sparing the American audience from reading subtitles (I&#39;m looking at you, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and every other Hollywood movie ever made). In fact, the entire first act takes place in India, where about 40 minutes of the film rides on the shoulders of a first time child actor – played by the wonderful Sunny Pawar – and it&#39;s one of the best first acts I&#39;ve seen in years. Think of it like the silent first act of Wall-E; it feels like it can be its own film, yet the filmmakers do a great job connecting the story once Dev Patel comes on screen.On top of that, the filmmaking is impressive. The script is fantastic, the cinematography is lush, the soundtrack complements the film really nicely, and the pacing is on point where it rarely feels like it&#39;s dragging, despite the story taking place over the course of 25 years. Every actor in here is also terrific in their roles. As stated earlier, Sunny Pawar makes a compelling lead for the first third of the film. If Oscars were given to kid actors, he would have a damn good chance at winning one. For the last two thirds, Dev Patel more than carries the rest of the film, giving an emotionally naked performance worthy enough to top his role in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE. Finally, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman, and David Wenham are ace, despite all of them having limited screen time.In a time where diversity is being talked about more in the film industry, LION makes a compelling case for having diversity in storytelling. It&#39;s not about a guy meeting his girlfriend&#39;s parents for the first time. It&#39;s not about a group of friends going in a cabin in the woods. It&#39;s not even about a guy/girl struggling with the death of his/her father/mother/son/daughter/dog. No, LION is a personal story unique to South Asians growing up in India, and it&#39;s refreshing and easily one of the best films the year has to offer. Don&#39;t dismiss this as yet another Oscar bait movie put out by the Weinstein Company – it probably is one. But the film is much more than that. With a distinct vision from director Garth Davis, LION offers an enthralling story that deserves to be seen by everyone."

It packs a magnificent camera work, high production values, luxurious design, violent images and a lot of sex scenes, including intercourse on the beach. A lavish production with a deep criticism on Spanish colonialism of the fifties by using a great number of flashbacks and flashforwards. Average acting by Mario Casas as a young who never left the far mountains of Huesca and comes to Guinea to find knowledge, pain and maturity . Adriana Ugarte Is better than him as the young woman who unfolds secrets of her ascendants. Support cast is pretty good, such as Alain Hernandez, Macarena Garcia, Daniel Grao, Berta Vazquez, , Luis Callejo, Fernando Cayo, Djedje Apali, Petra Martinez, Celso Bugallo as an adult Killian and veteran incombustible Emilio Gutierrez Caba.It displays a sensitive and stirring musical score by Lucas Vidal. It contains a brilliant and colorful cinematography by Xavi Gimenez. Shot on location in Llanos del Hospital Huesca, Bahia Solano, Colombia and Palmas de Gran Canaria. The motion picture written
by Sergio G. Sanchez was well directed by Fernando Gonzalez Molina, but being extremely overlong, almost three hours . He has made some successful films as Brain drain, 3 steps above heaven, I want you and The invisible guardian. And he directed notorious Tv series as Paco&#39;s men, The boat, Luna el misterio de Calenda and a documentary, The best day of my life. Rating 7/10. Well worth watching."

That was a film that used history to tell a story about real people who had a love to change a nation. In this version of the eponymous Phillipa Gregory novel, historical inaccuracies abound. Approximately fifteen years are compressed into two hours with no indication time has gone by except for various babies. None of the characters ever change or grow any older. The characters in this movie are completely one-sided. Anne is ambitious. Henry is a womanizer. Mary is simple. No one has any complexities. The sisterly rivalry plays out like an underdeveloped soap opera. On the other hand, the film is engaging and the costumes lovely. Same with the gorgeous palace settings. Eye candy it is.

This movie completely exceeded my expectations. As I write this, the tears are drying on my face. I believed the chemistry was there with the actors and the romance had a good build-up (not rushed). I like that the story was easy to follow. The actions scenes were well-directed and realistic. I like how the story incorporates action, suspense, drama, and romance, all in one.

This is the story of Danish artist Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) who realised that despite being born a man he is really a woman and that woman is called Lile. Although Redmayne will quite obviously get all the praise for his role as Lile but I think the outstanding performance of this film comes from Alicia Vikander who plays his wife. As an actor she is exposed unlike Redmayne who has the make up to hide behind. Instead of being about Lile this film for me is more about the love of his wife who will do anything to make her husband happy. Even if that means losing him. in the process.

tt2334733,138. Madame Bovary,5.7,2014,9100.0,1h 58m,R,"First, the short summary at the top of the IMDb page COMPLETELY MISREPRESENTS the plot of the movie and novel. Madame Bovary is not simply cheating on her husband to advance her social status.Her affairs are part of a much more profound struggle for transcendence from the ordinary life in which she feels trapped. That&#39;s why the novel is a classic of modern literature. The way IMDb puts it makes it sound like a cheap Lifetime movie.Second, Mia Wasikowska is a fine actress but I&#39;ve always imagined Madame Bovary as a much more sensual woman.Third, I think Ezra Miller was terribly miscast as Leon Dupuis. Not to disparage his acting, but he&#39;s far too young and effeminate to be an object of desire for Emma Bovary.While the film was beautifully shot, it otherwise doesn&#39;t quite do justice to Flaubert. Perhaps my expectations were too high."

It tells the story as it is and doesn&#39;t dodge any of the emotional and physical abuse suffered by Kampusch.The relationship between Kampusch and her kidnapper and how it develops over time is one of the most interesting parts of the story and the film did a really good job at portraying this. Antonia Campbell-Hughes deserves a lot of credit for delivering a strong performance as Kampusch - it must have been a huge challenge, especially given her drastic change in appearance for the role.This is a raw and naturally disturbing film that is not for everybody.

A woman wakes up each day with no memory beyond her early twenties; soon she begins to realise that some dark secrets are being hidden from her. It&#39;s sort of in similar territory to Christopher Nolan&#39;s early neo-noir Memento (2000), which was also a mystery/thriller about a character with a short-term memory loss condition. Like that one, here one of the interesting angles is that the central character has no idea if their friends really are friends or actually enemies. It&#39;s true that several aspects of the storyline require you to stretch your belief somewhat; however, many thrillers are similar in this respect, so this wasn&#39;t such a deal-breaker for me. The problem I essentially had is that while the idea may be pretty intriguing, ultimately the pay-off is somewhat mediocre and conventional. Piece by piece the puzzle is slowly unravelled but it doesn&#39;t end up presenting us with a picture that is very inspired or interesting and you sort of ask yourself &#39;is that it?&#39;"

The story takes place in the French aristocracy during the &#39;Wars of Religion&#39;, the conflict involved the factional disputes between the aristocratic houses of France, such as the House of Bourbon and House of Guise (Lorraine), and both sides received assistance from foreign sources , focusing on a young woman named Marie De Mezières (Mélanie Thierry in the title role) who falls in love for her dashing cousin Henri De Guiseis (Gaspard Ulliel) but she is forced into marriage with the well-connected nobleman Philippe De Montpensier (Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet), who she has never met , while she falls passionately in love with another man . When Philippe is called away to battle , she is taken in the care of Count Chabannes (Lambert Wilson) , an aging aristocrat , and soon later becomes involved to the sexual and political intrigues of court , including the throne heir , Duc d&#39;Anjou (Raphaël Personnaz) and Queen , Catherine of Medicis (Evelina Meghnagi).This historic drama contains romance , intrigue , swordplay , spectacular battles and wonderful outdoors . It&#39;s a sweeping and romantic historical epic with a simple message : passion destroys everything . The film packs a French all-star-cast , as it stars model turned actress , Melaney Thierry , Lambert Wilson as Comte De Chabannes , Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet as Prince De Montpensier , Gaspard Ulliel as Henri De Guise and Raphaël Personnaz as Duc D&#39;Anjou . Evocative and imaginative Original Music by Philippe Sarde . Gorgeous and luxurious Cinematography by Bruno De Keyzer . Impressive Production Design by Guy-Claude François , showing breathtaking outdoors , luxurious palaces and rousing Chateaus . The picture was well directed by Bertrand Tavernier, based on the short story by author &#39;Madame De La Fayette&#39;. Bertrand is a good French director who has been making from the 70s notorious films such as The clockmaker 1974 , The judge and the assassin 1976 , 1280 souls 1981 , A Sunday in the country 1984 , Round midnight 1986 , law 627 , Daughter&#39;s Dartagnan 1994 , Captain Conan 1995 , All starts today 1999 , Laissez-passer 2002 and In the electric mist 2009 . The flick is inspired by historical events , though predominates the passional drama . The actual deeds were the following : The long conflict involved the factional fights between the aristocratic houses of France and Catholic and Protestant ; specially St. Bartholomew&#39;s Day massacre (1572) , as the Queen Mother , Catherina of Medicis became increasingly fearful of the unchecked power wielded by Coligny and his supporters, especially as it became clear that Coligny was pursuing an alliance with the Dutch Protestant rebels. Coligny, along with many other Calvinist nobles, arrived in Paris for the wedding of the Catholic Princess Marguerite de Valois to the Protestant Henry of Navarre on August 18. On August 22, an assassin made a failed attempt on Coligny&#39;s life, shooting him in the street .Amidst fears of a Huguenot coup, the Duke of Guise and his supporters acted. In the early morning of August 24, they killed Coligny in his lodgings . Coligny&#39;s body was thrown from the window into the street, and was subsequently mutilated, castrated, dragged through the mud, thrown in the river, suspended on a gallows and burned by the Parisian crowd. For the next five days, the city erupted as Catholics massacred Calvinist men, women and children, and looted their houses, which was neither approved of nor predicted by the king. Over the next few weeks, the disorder spread to more than a dozen cities across France. Historians estimate that 2,000 Huguenots were killed in Paris and thousands more in the provinces; in all, perhaps 10,000 people were killed. Henry of Navarre and his cousin, the young Prince of Condé, managed to avoid death by agreeing to convert to Catholicism; both would repudiate their conversions once they escaped Paris.Some assert that the Edict of Nantes in 1598 concluded the wars, although a resurgence of rebellious activity following this leads some to believe the Peace of Alais in 1629 is the actual conclusion. However, the Massacre of Vassy in 1562 is agreed to begin the Wars of Religion and the Edict of Nantes at least ended this series of conflicts. During this time, complex diplomatic negotiations and agreements of peace were followed by renewed conflict and power struggles.At the conclusion of the conflict in 1598, Huguenots were granted substantial rights and freedoms by the Edict of Nantes, though it did not end hostility towards them. The wars weakened the authority of the monarchy, already fragile under the rule of Francis II and then Charles IX, though it later reaffirmed its role under Henry IV."

The movie talks about it, but it&#39;s only from a Christian&#39;s point of view. I liked the concept of the movie. They don&#39;t actually make us believe in the existence of heaven (or hell), but the good thing about the movie is that, they&#39;ve kept an effort to show how the world would react when something extraordinary happens. Whatever, the story and the concept touched my heart. It would have been better if they had gone deeper than this. They could have taken the lines of Bible or so, in order to have a factual conversations.Movie says, it&#39;s based on a true story but when there&#39;s talking about Jesus, it becomes a Christian&#39;s story, not universal. It&#39;s not a must watch movie but I would recommend it. I say, we&#39;ve always watched Sci-Fi movies when we know they are not true, why don&#39;t we give a try to some spiritual movies? For most of the people today, they would be only as true as the sci-fi. There&#39;s no any magic in the story, just some story of miracles. What if it was &#39;Your&#39; story? How would you make people believe in you encountering miracles? While the movie may not be at it best, it&#39;s not bad for a one time viewing. My rating would be 7 for the story, acting, dialogues and well, because it has some sort of influence to the society..."
tt0900387,148. Suite Française,7.0,2014,30000.0,1h 47m,Not Rated,"There&#39;s a story behind this movies existence that is as interesting as the film itself. It&#39;s disappointing to know that scenes involving the original story writers daughter (played by veteran Eileen Atkins) were deleted prior to the films release. Unfortunately, all that&#39;s left of these scenes is a montage of pages from her mothers original manuscript shown under the end credits - using these notes in this way can prove a little confusing for those unaware of the origins of these writings - as it tends to appear as if the films story was based on factual characters (while I&#39;m sure many were indeed based on very real people and for the most part the instances portrayed were founded on some terrible historical facts). The author of the original story, Irene Nemirovsky, was tragically sent to her death at the hands of the invading German army following bitter fighting during the occupation of France in 1942. Her husband, before he also was executed, gave their daughter Denise his wife&#39;s manuscripts. Denise, for emotional reasons did not read her mother&#39;s writings till an astounding 60yrs later. She eventually had them compiled into a novel that was published in 2002 - becoming an international best seller. Story rights were then sold for production as a screenplay. Denise sadly died just before the films release. To play the main protagonist producers cast Michele Williams (My week With Marilyn &#39;11) mother to the late Heath Ledgers daughter. Considering some of William&#39;s earlier roles she is nothing short of remarkable - turning in a convincingly measured performance as the repressed Lucile Angellier. This is more than a conventional wartime romantic movie as it deals realistically with the shocking impact of oppression and the devastating consequences it brings to all involved. Perhaps had the film makers paid a little less attention to the screenplays various sexual intrigues, they may have been able to treat us to those deleted scenes detailing the fascinating real life story - involving the writers daughter discovering her mothers work all those years after the event!. Director and co-screenplay writer Saul Dibb along with collaborating writer Matt Charman - join forces with director of photography Eduard Grau to create some remarkably atmospheric scenes. One well executed sequence featuring endless lines of displaced French families fleeing the relentless onslaught on foot, is a sad and dramatic sight.Those who remain in their homes are met with enforced billeting of German Officers - this brings out the worst of human nature with neighboring villagers sending notes &#39;rating&#39; on their fellow neighbor&#39;s to gain favour from the Germans - a shocking act indeed. Music plays a key role throughout the film with a romantic piano soliloquy composed by Alexandre Desplate played throughout. The exciting accompanying action score is contributed by Rael Jones. Overall this is a sincere portrait of a dreadful time in human history and while the the script may falter in several situations it&#39;s far more thoughtful than some other offerings along these lines. Performances are strong with a sterling cast of professionals working at their peak.Note: This film is remarkably similar to an earlier production, staring the great Maria Schell &quot;So Little Time&quot; &#39;52&quot; - this marvelous classic film has recently been released on DVD in England and is more than well worth locating."

tt2402101,150. Dark Places,6.2,2015,49000.0,1h 53m,R,"A lot of people compare Dark Places to Gone Girl and say, book-wise, Gone Girl was the better book. I actually liked Dark Places better, so when I found out they were making it into a movie, I was of course skeptical about whether or not it&#39;d be good. I just finished watching it and was happy that my skepticism was for naught - this movie stayed true to the book. Casting was done well and the flow proved that the screenplay writers &amp; director paid attention to the original book.The book is dark, has some twists and turns and doesn&#39;t gloss over anything. Where in Gone Girl I felt like some scenes were made a little lighter for the screen, Dark Places doesn&#39;t have that issue. The sets were also very accurate - it&#39;s been YEARS since I read the book, but while watching the movie everything came back to me...the layout of the farm house, the crappy apartment Libby lived in as an adult with her collection of stolen items...all the way down to crap hole Runner was living in...This is not going to be a big blockbuster. Most people will not like it (as you can tell by the ratings) but I will tell you, if you like thrillers/mysteries with twists and turns then watch it. If you&#39;ve read the book, watch it. It&#39;s not the greatest movie ever done, but it was good enough that I felt compelled to write my first IMDb review.And even if you don&#39;t watch the movie, read the book. If you like Patterson, Demille or Clancy, you&#39;ll like Dark Places."

tt3316960,153. Still Alice,7.5,2014,147000.0,1h 41m,PG-13,"Still Alice is a realistic and emotional story of a woman living with Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Julianne Moore successfully shows the struggle, confusion, anger, pain and isolation of having such a disease through her incredible performance. She allows the audience to see what having Alzheimer&#39;s could possibly be like. This film also has an amazing screenplay, a screenplay that is raw and honest. There is also a great ensemble performance from the cast, featuring Alec Baldwin as the supportive and loving husband. The movie definitely makes the viewer think deeply about aspects of life such as memories, family, loss and bewilderment which are all addressed in Still Alice. See this film for a moving story, but mostly for Moore&#39;s miraculous performance. It wouldn&#39;t be a surprise if she won Best Actress in the upcoming Academy Awards."

Consisting of furtive looks &amp; moody zooms, Diary hearkens back to the films of the 70&#39;s that Bunuel or Truffaut may&#39;ve made but the modernity of Seydoux&#39;s casting keeps things interesting when the plot &amp; scenery start to falter towards the mundane.

These is one of those movies and the responsibility lies in one name: Leonardo Sbaraglia. Yes, the story is not 10 stars, but the performance of Sbaraglia along with the argentine badlands, the cruel way in which poverty is presented and the bizarre relationships between the characters make these movie a must-see if you&#39;re a fan of the Argentinian films like &quot;El Secreto De Sus Ojos&quot;, &quot;Relatos Salvajes&quot;, &quot;Nueve Reinas&quot; and the list goes on. It could be better, no doubt, but Sbaraglia&#39;s performance worth the time."
tt2884018,156. Macbeth,6.6,2015,61000.0,1h 53m,R,"Was actually really looking forward to seeing this 2015 film version of &#39;Macbeth&#39;. The play is one of Shakespeare&#39;s best, most famous and most quotable and has leant itself to film, with Roman Polanski, Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa all giving it splendid treatment. The cast is a talented one, having often admired Michael Fassbender, Marion Cottilard and David Thewlis and ever since seeing him in &#39;The Borgias&#39; Sean Harris struck me as one to watch.Not to mention the great reviews. Was a little worried though too, seeing that it was directed by Justin Kurzel who directed the big misfire and huge waste of potential that was &#39;Assassins Creed&#39;. Luckily, this &#39;Macbeth&#39; lived up to expectations on the whole if not exceeding them. It is not the definitive version of the play, either on film or filmed production, and did have room for improvement, but for all its flaws the film on the whole surprisingly impressed me.This &#39;Macbeth&#39; isn&#39;t perfect. It is agreed not always easy to understand the dialogue, which didn&#39;t need to be as hushed or as muttered. While the film a vast majority of the time looked absolutely great, there is a gratuitous overuse of slow-motion.Especially in the first 10 minutes or so, which were more sluggish than arresting. There are cuts and some of the omissions do affect the drama where the storytelling becomes less coherent.For all those drawbacks, there are a lot of positives with this &#39;Macbeth&#39;. Other than the slow motion, it is quite an amazing looking film, with hugely atmospheric and grandiose visuals (from the suitably myterious fog early on right up to the boldly bloodthirsty climax). The photography to me was some of the best of that year, especially in the act and those locations are hugely effective in their atmosphere, uncompromising but also oddly beautiful and dark without taking it to extremes. The music is still haunting and Kurzel&#39;s direction is bolder and less muddled than it was in &#39;Assassins Creed&#39; from the following year.Moreover, although it would have been nice if it was more consistently intelligible, Shakespeare&#39;s text is still powerful and hard to forget. The story takes time to get going but does get more compelling and remarkably ambitious, at its most emotionally investable from the point where Macduff learning of his family&#39;s murder (which has always been a very moving part of the plot) up to the end. The action is both exciting and ferociously harrowing, pulling no punches without being too unnecessarily over the top (seeing as &#39;Macbeth&#39; is already a dramatically brutal play).Some interesting changes here. Really did like that the witches weren&#39;t portrayed in a way that was too reliant on witch cliches, and were spooky underneath their deceptive exteriors. Lady Macbeth is still an effective and steely manipulator but it was interesting to see a more conflicted side to her (very different as it is not what the play indicates) rather than her being completely villainous. This is not going to work for some, but to me it was interesting. The performances were on the whole great from all, Fassbender is searingly fierce in the title role without being too brutish and Cotillard contrasts with him effectively as a steely and imperious Lady Macbeth. Paddy Considine&#39;s Banquo is suitably noble and Harris proved in &#39;The Borgias&#39; that he could do creepy but also tortured, and he is very moving here as Macduff. It is somewhat sad that Duncan&#39;s role in the play is not bigger because Thewlis, while perhaps a touch young, commands the part extremely well.In conclusion, intriguing and well done but there are better versions of &#39;Macbeth&#39; around. 7/10"
tt0338467,157. High Roller: The Stu Ungar Story,6.0,2003,2400.0,1h 50m,R,"This film appeared on cable television under the title of &quot;High Roller.&quot; It is a well-crafted biographical portrait of three-time world champion poker player Stu Ungar. In life, Stu&#39;s nickname was &quot;The Kid,&quot; and the film chronicles the descent of an intelligent young man with great promise, who becomes addicted to gambling and ruins all of that potential. As Stu, Michael Imperioli delivers an engaging and credible performance, capturing the essence of a life spiraling out of control from the craving of high-stakes gambling. The cast surrounding Imperioli is excellent, especially veteran actor Pat Morita, who plays a Las Vegas gambling impresario. The film&#39;s production values fall somewhere between a competent made-for-television movie and a workmanlike low-budget feature film, attempting valiantly to convey the period styles of the final four decades of the twentieth century. There is one revealing scene with documentary footage of the classic Las Vegas Sands Hotel being imploded and crashing to the ground. That moment vividly sums up of the sad life of Stu Ungar."
tt0077413,158. Death on the Nile,7.3,1978,42000.0,2h 20m,PG,"This movie was the first and best of Peter Ustinov&#39;s performances as Hercule Poirot.  Though physically not very accurate to Agatha Christie&#39;s description of the little Belgian detective, for this one movie everything worked and the discrepancy was not a problem.  The film is well-paced, with all the plot turns and clues coming with perfect timing, not too fast to be confusing, but not too slow to strain the rather flimsy fabric of the story. The whole cast is very good, especially Bette Davis as a malevolent old spider of a woman, gleefully tormenting her long-suffering companion, Maggie Smith. The scene where she smiles indulgently at a group of Egyptian children waving at her on the river bank, only to sink into mortified disgust as they turn around and moon her, is a highlight of the movie.  The climax of the film is quite surprising, and unlike many mysteries, does not cheat the viewer by withholding vital information until the last moment.  We feel the pleasure of being honestly fooled throughout, and the conclusion is thoroughly satisfying."
tt0090156,159. Thirteen at Dinner,6.2,1985,2800.0,1h 27m,Not Rated,"&quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot; is good, solid entertainment. I recently watched it on video, and apart from the obvious, dramatic commercial pauses, it was hard to tell I was watching a made-for-TV movie. Ustinov is my favorite Poirot, and he is his usual, boisterous self in this adaptation. I love David Suchet as well, and I was delighted to see him in the role of Inspector Japp. Is there a better voice actor than Suchet? If one were to listen to this movie with closed eyes, it would be very hard to tell that Japp was being played by Suchet, so convincing is his accent and manner of speech.This production has a very British feel to it, but apparently it was an American venture. Surprising! Also, I had a bad feeling when I saw the opening scene- Poirot appearing on the David Frost talk show! But the filmakers and screenwriters did an excellent job of taking a novel written in the &#39;30s and adapting it to the mid-&#39;80s. They followed Christie&#39;s original plot faithfully, keeping all the essential elements which make it such a good whodunnit. It would have been nice to see a different actress play the part of Carlotta Adams (Faye Dunaway plays both her and Jane Wilkinson.) She did a commendable job though, as did the other supporting actors. I thought the interplay between Ustinov and Johnathan Cecil (who played Hastings) was hilarious. And I really wish that Ustinov had made more Poirot movies! Oh well. Check out &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; for another of Ustinov&#39;s best Poirot efforts. Hard core fans will want to see &quot;Appointment With Death&quot; as well, but that film ranks at the bottom of my Poirot list."
tt0051201,160. Witness for the Prosecution,8.4,1957,150000.0,1h 56m,Approved,"I love it when a movie captivates me, carries me along, then surprises me at the end. This is a masterpiece of human maneuvering. It has outstanding acting and a plot to die for. This is a fairly pedestrian Agatha Christie short story. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not a wonderful story, just that it doesn&#39;t come to life like it does on the screen. Charles Laughton is the wonder barrister who is taking the case, even though he is in poor health. The murder case seems a relatively simple one until we begin to trip over the many layers left lying on the path. Marlene Dietrich does a masterful job in all her roles (I won&#39;t say anymore than that so I don&#39;t spoil the ending). Tyrone Power is able to balance his pathos and his potential guilt. The beauty of the movie is that it never takes itself too seriously. There are some modestly funny subplots and a great deal of careful investigation. I guarantee you that once you start watching, you won&#39;t be able to turn it off."
tt0083908,161. Evil Under the Sun,7.0,1982,22000.0,1h 57m,PG,"Peter Ustinov recreates the role of Poirot, following the wonderful Death On The Nile.   This is not the story as Agatha Christie wrote it, but here we have a rare example of the movie being better than the book.  In fact it would be more accurate to say that here we have a murder mystery based on an idea by Miss Christie.  We are presented with is a cast of characters, a murder victim, and just about everyone has a motive. Poirot of course, deduces who did it.  The sun in question, under which this evil takes place, shines down on a privately owned island in the Mediterranean, giving us a warm and exotic location.There isn&#39;t one bad performance among the cast, several of whom have appeared before in at least one other Poirot story.  Maggie Smith and Jane Birkin in Evil Under The Sun;  Dennis Quilley and Colin Blakely in Murder On The Orient Express.   Diana Rigg and Maggie Smith almost steal the show as two women who smile sweetly at each other as they spit venom!  But every bit as good are Blakely, Quilley, Mason, McDowall and the rest.  And while all this is going on, the soundtrack is solid gold Cole Porter, which has been orchestrated perfectly to fit the story.This movie is pure fun.  Make yourself comfortable, suspend disbelief and allow yourself to be transported to another era and location for a couple of hours of enjoyment."
tt0089640,162. Murder with Mirrors,6.3,1985,1700.0,1h 40m,Not Rated,"If &quot;A Caribbean Mystery&quot; (1983) was the traditional &quot;murder at an exotic resort during the holidays&quot; story, &quot;Murder with Mirrors&quot; (1985) is the traditional &quot;murder in a huge English countryside manor&quot; story. It was the second and last appearance of Helen Hayes as Agatha Christie&#39;s Miss Marple, and it&#39;s a shame she didn&#39;t make any more: she is a very wily yet very human Marple, and acts quite youthfully for her 80+ years. The films themselves are better than the TV movies with Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot that were made around the same time, mainly because they don&#39;t overplay the comedy. Although the big names in the supporting cast are an old Bette Davis and a young Tim Roth, if anyone stands out it&#39;s the beautiful redhead Liane Langland and Leo McKern as the inspector on the case. The story contains the typical AC false assumptions and crafty illusions, and I, for one, did not have a clue what was going on until Miss Marple and the inspector revealed it. A good solid outing for fans of the genre. (***)"
tt0055205,163. Murder She Said,7.3,1961,9000.0,1h 27m,Approved,"So yes, Miss Agatha Christie herself did not quite care for Miss Margaret Rutherford in the role but Miss Rutherford made of the part her own in her own inimitable fashion even going to the extent of having her very own obedient side-kick, her real-life husband Stringer Davis, known as Jim Stringer in the series, inserted into it. She called the shots and kept the studio afloat. And what a series! This is the first in it and it evokes the era extraordinarily well, the quick murder and disposal of the body, the old country house, the many suspicious relatives and one of my favourites, James Robertson Justice heading up the entire clan. He even gets to propose to the lady herself, so impressed is he with her detecting.Add the requisite cute kid, Ronnie Raymond, an excellent bit part by Joan Hickson (the future Miss Marple in the excellent BBC series) and what faults are there to be found in this unique first film of four in the series.8 out of 10. Incredibly entertaining, wonderful use of black and white film medium and a really good score."
tt0060094,164. The Alphabet Murders,5.3,1965,2000.0,1h 30m,,"Based on Agatha Christie&#39;s &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot;, with Tony Randall as an unlikely choice for Hercule Poirot. If you take your Christie seriously, this probably isn&#39;t for you, but it is a fun light mystery. Poirot is in London when a string of murders peaks his interest--the only motive seems to be the initials of the victims..A.A., B.B., etc. I enjoyed the pairing of Robert Morley and Randall. Morley, as the official assigned to escort Poirot about town, spends most of his time playing catch-up with calm exasperation..very British. Although some Poirot portrayals feature a humorous side, this one includes more physical comedy..perhaps an inspiration of director Frank Tashlin, who directed numerous Jerry Lewis films.For the Miss Marple fans, there is even a humorous cameo by Margaret Rutherford and Stringer Davis, bemoaning the ineptitude of the police in solving the murders. Evidently, Ms Christie didn&#39;t like this movie--I don&#39;t know if it was the changes from the book (Anita Ekberg&#39;s character was a dark, tr oubled man in the book..) or the casting, but of course, she didn&#39;t like the Margaret Rutherford series either..go figure. Although Randall isn&#39;t who I think of when I think of Poirot, his comedic timing payed off here, and you know from the very start he intends to have fun with the role. Not my favorite Christie, but entertaining..glad I finally got to see it."

tt0058383,166. Murder Most Foul,7.1,1964,6600.0,1h 30m,Approved,"Like an intrepid war ship that patrols the high seas, wonderful Margaret Rutherford patrols a theatrical troupe of actors and actresses known as the Cosgood Players, searching for a killer-most-foul amongst them. And a killer she finds, lurking in the backstage shadows, in this screen adaptation of Agatha Christie&#39;s book &quot;Mrs. McGinty&#39;s Dead&quot;.It&#39;s a nifty whodunit. I was fairly sure who the murderer was. But I was dead wrong. With good film direction, and effective plot misdirection, the film cleverly leads viewers down the garden path, with red herrings scattered here and there. As you make your way through the story, you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find the relevant clues, plainly visible, but camouflaged amid a complexity of detail. And that&#39;s the mark of a good murder mystery.If I had to pick the script apart, looking for something to complain about, I could point out that the various suspects have back-stories that are all too thin. But that&#39;s normal, more or less, for films in this genre.En route to the solution of the puzzle, Miss Marple (Rutherford) auditions to be part of the theater troupe, in a solo recital of the Robert Service poem &quot;The Shooting Of Dan McGrew&quot;. This sequence alone, with Rutherford&#39;s terrifically hammy stage performance, is enough to make the film worth watching.In searching for the killer, the befuddled police don&#39;t have a clue, of course. But with her keen wit and perceptive insight into human nature, Miss Marple sifts and sorts through the jumble of facts with cunning effectiveness. The film&#39;s final few minutes take place behind the stage of a play in progress, where she conks the murderer over the head with a stage prop. Marvelous.As a whodunit, &quot;Murder Most Foul&quot; is a good one. But what really makes the film enjoyable is Rutherford in the role of Miss Marple. With her animated facial expressions, her commanding tone of voice, and her formidable and intimidating stage presence, 72 year old Margaret Rutherford is an absolute joy to watch. I&#39;m surprised that the British didn&#39;t name a battleship after her."
tt0090914,167. Dead Man's Folly,6.3,1986,2400.0,1h 30m,Not Rated,"I haven&#39;t read the book Dead Man&#39;s Folly, and this TV movie is the only one of the 6 movies Peter Ustinov did as Poirot, where that is the case. Now Dead Man&#39;s Folly I found to be very entertaining, with very good performances and a fine denouncement. However the script was weak and underdeveloped in places, the music didn&#39;t really stand out unlike Death On the Nile(the music was absolutely superb in that movie) and I found the overall film to be a tad too broad. I don&#39;t think it is as good as Death on the Nile or Evil Under the Sun, which are the best of the Ustinov outings. On a positive note, for a TV movie, it looks beautiful, with wonderful period detail, pleasant scenery and very nice photography. And the clothes were lovely to look at too. The denouncement is very unexpected and cleverly done, and I wouldn&#39;t have guessed it in a million years. But what makes the film so enjoyable is the cast. While I still consider David Suchet to be the definitive Poirot, Peter Ustinov was still a joy to behold and is clearly enjoying himself. Jean Stapleton positively brings life to the proceedings as Ariadne Oliver. Both Kenneth Cranham and Tim Piggott-Smith give good performances, if playing it safe. Jonathan Cecil is very entertaining as Hastings and Nicollette Sheridan is lovely as Hattie. But other than Ustinov the standout was indeed Constance Cummings as Amy, a truly delightful performance. All in all, while not the best of the Ustinov Poirot outings, it is a glossy and entertaining one, and actually one of the better ones. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0991347,168. The Great Alibi,5.4,2008,681.0,1h 33m,,"The legal successors of Agatha Christie were known to be very strict with film producers. Their terms of reference indeed implied that the screen adaptations of Lady Agatha&#39;s mysteries were to be set exclusively within the four-decade period (1920&#39;s-1960&#39;s) in which she had been active and in the very places she had described (England most of the time of course). Then in 2000 or thereabouts they suddenly relented and started accepting adaptations that were less faithful to the letter provided of course they stuck to the spirit of the original work. As a result, the stories could be updated, the action relocated while the sacrosanct investigators (Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, ) could be replaced by more anonymous though not necessarily less colorful local sleuthsWould Miss Christie&#39;s celebrated whodunits survive such a treatment? It looks as though they do. In France Pascal Thomas was the first to step into the breach (he made two adaptations, &#39;Mon petit doigt m&#39;a dit&#39; and &#39;L&#39;heure zéro&#39; and his currently shooting his third one). Now it is Pascal Bonitzer&#39;s turn to offer French viewers his own re-reading of &#39;The Hollow&#39;, first published in 1944, oddly retitled &#39;Le grand alibi&#39; (a title previously used for the dubbed version of Hitchcok&#39;s &#39;Stage Fright&#39;).The common point of the three films is that their plot has been transposed to contemporary France, that they are very faithful to the source novel (their plot twists have not been altered or very little) and that they play by the rules of the detective story genre, never outsmarting the writer and each time providing the viewer with a very satisfying mystery climax.What distinguishes them is the tone adopted. While Thomas&#39; two films have a quirky offbeat poetic humor Bonitzer slashes at his characters in a harsher, more down-to-earth way, notably through nasty, biting dialogs.A senator (self-assured, no-nonsense Arditi), his conventional wife (hilariously goody-goody Miou-Miou), some of their relatives and their guests (womanizer Lambert Wilson, sex-bomb-with a brain Caterina Murino and others all played by very competent actors) are not left unscathed by Bonitzer (and Christie, it goes without saying)&#39;s scalpel. Anyway, whether adapted by Thomas or Bonitzer, evidence is that there is more to Agatha Christie&#39;s crime stories than just well constructed but hollow pulp fiction. What allows her writings to transcend time and borders is the characters she created, most of them hiding their vices behind the varnish of good manners. Finding the murderer is also unveiling the dark side of human nature. What is more universal?"

They have nothing in common except that each of them harbours a guilty secret and they have all been invited by a mysterious host (whom none of them has met) called Mr U.N Owen. The guests are Judge Arthur Cannon (Wilfrid Hyde-White), Harley Street practitioner Dr Armstrong (Dennis Price), private eye William Henry Blore (Stanley Holloway), actress Ilona Bergen (Daliah Lavi), pop star Mike Raven (Fabian), retired army officer General Sir John Mandrake (Leo Genn), engineer Hugh Lombard (Hugh O&#39; Brien), secretary Ann Clyde (Shirley Eaton) and housekeepers Joseph and Elsa Grohmann (Mario Adorf &amp; Marrianne Hoppe). They are curious and slightly annoyed that their host isn&#39;t their to greet them. However, after dinner and cocktails, a tape recorder bursts into life and the disembodied voice of their host accuses each of them of a past crime. Initially, they treat it as a sick joke in the poorest taste. But after Mike Raven has drunkenly sang a rendition of the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme on the piano, he confesses to a crime before choking on his drink and falling down dead. The others realise that this isn&#39;t a joke and that their host is a psychopath delivering retribution for their sins and even more disturbingly, their killer is one of them. In addition, there is a centerpiece on the dining room table, which contains ten figurines and as they are murdered one by one in ways parallel to the old nursery rhyme, the killer removes one figurine from the centrepiece at a time.Ten Little Indians was the third film version of Agatha Christie&#39;s marvelous mystery thriller, which was first published in Great Britain in 1939. Four years later, it was adapted for the stage by the author making its debut at London&#39;s St James Theatre in November 1943. It had been previously filmed in Hollywood in 1945 as And Then There Were None (Dir: Rene Clair) and featured an all-star cast (for the time) including Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Huston and in 1949, the BBC produced a TV version starring Bruce Belfrage and Campbell Singer. The 1965 version made a few notable changes, the most significant being the change of setting from an old house on a remote Devonshire island to a mansion on top of the Austrian Alps. The picture was actually shot in an empty mansion in Rush near Dublin, Southern Ireland. The film was produced by Harry Alan Towers whom at this time was enjoying success with the splendid schoolboy&#39;s adventure yarn The Face Of Fu Manchu, which starred Christopher Lee as Sax Rohmer&#39;s fiendish Oriental mastermind. Interestingly, it was Lee who provided the disembodied voice of U.N Owen on the tape recording heard at the beginning of the film. Towers would subsequently go on to film the story again on two more occasions. First as And Then There Were None (Dir: Peter Collinson 1975), in which the setting was changed yet again to a luxury hotel in the Iranian desert and the second time in 1989 with the drama unfolding from a big game African safari.All in all, Ten Little Indians is quite a good film. The script penned by Towers as Peter Welbeck does reasonable justice to Christie&#39;s wonderful source novel and the change of locale does it no harm at all. A marvelous cast was chosen for the film with Wilfrid Hyde-White perfectly cast as the intelligent and resourceful Judge Cannon while Dennis Price offers a fine portrayal as the upper class Dr Armstrong. Leo Genn gives just the right amount of authority to the role of General Sir John Mandrake and Hugh O&#39; Brien is suitably smooth as Lombard and works well with Shirley Eaton&#39;s Ann Clyde, the picture&#39;s love interest. Also of note is American pop singer Fabian who does well in portraying Mike Raven an updated version of Christie&#39;s original character called Anthony Marston in the book. The character wasn&#39;t a pop star in the book at all, but he still resembles the way that Christie described him, irresponsible, and whose only interest in life was &quot;for kicks&quot; as the film puts it.On the downside, the film lacks the tension and the sense of menace that I was expecting mainly due to an unsuitable jazz style music score and while the black and white camera-work is good, I couldn&#39;t help but think that a few more shadows would have helped here and there. Director George Pollock (fresh from shooting the Margaret Rutherford Miss Marple films) shows a steady hand at the helm of the picture and brings the storyline together beautifully but he doesn&#39;t bring the same level of charm and well-meshed humor and mystery, which he brought to the Marple series here. Another slight disappointment is the climax, which resembles the happy and romantic one from the stage play. In the novel (I won&#39;t give it away for those who haven&#39;t seen the film or read the book) but there is no sense of relief at all and as a result the film isn&#39;t as dark and surprising as I was hoping it would be. I also felt that the 60-second whodunit break just prior to the ending didn&#39;t really fit in the with the general aura of the movie and seemed to be nothing more than a gimmick. Overall, however, this is still the film which I return to of one of my all time favorite mysteries because the cast play it straight here whereas in the 1945 version, they overplayed the comedy meaning that it sat uneasily with the plot and a lot of the film&#39;s thrills took place off screen which isn&#39;t the case here. And finally, I cannot resist a picture that brings such wonderful actors as Wilfrid Hyde-White and Stanley Holloway together -not in a million years!"
tt0029171,170. A Night of Terror,6.5,1937,710.0,1h 26m,Approved,"A year or so before he worked with him for SON OF FRANKENSTEIN, director Rowland V. Lee unleashed a maniacal Basil Rathbone in this unusual thriller that&#39;s not really a &quot;good film&quot;, but is still pretty interesting and serves up a delicious climax if you can wait it out. Rathbone plays a suave ladies&#39; man who charms his way into the life of a young woman who&#39;s just won the lottery. They get married, and only then does the woman realize her husband is not what he seems and may have half his screws loose. If you don&#39;t love Basil&#39;s insane performance in SON OF FRANKENSTEIN, this will probably drive you even crazier; but if, like me, you think he&#39;s more fun than a barrel of monkeys when he lets it all hang out, this one is for you. The battle of wits at the end between Ann Harding and Rathbone has got to be seen to be believed! This one&#39;s a must if you love Basil Rathbone, and no Rathbone fan should dare miss it. **1/2 out of ****"

It relies on a fine cast to bring this murder mystery to life, including Jack Hulbert, Cicely Courtneidge, Ronald Howard, Ferdy Mayne, and Peter Butterworth as the befuddled inspector.It&#39;s been opened up slightly from the stage play, resulting in a four-set movie.Sometimes it seems as if makers of mystery movies have two choices: they can make a good mystery or they can make a good movie. This one is enlivened by a fine cast, but not enough to make it more than an indifferent programmer."

As a result, I spent the first half of the movie just trying to keep the female characters straight. Beautiful women are not enough to save this flimsiest of scripts, however. I feel cheated. I could&#39;ve been playing solitaire. It would&#39;ve been equally fulfilling. Clearly, I do not recommend this movie. I was hoping for so much more from a largely watchable cast."
tt0037515,174. And Then There Were None,7.4,1945,18000.0,1h 37m,Approved,"This is a dramatization of the consummate Agatha Christie book, the benchmark for the whodunit.  Each of the characters is nicely portrayed by accomplished actors.  The pacing, the subdued dialogue, all make this film work, even though it was felt necessary to doctor the plot and rename characters (this I will never understand).  I won&#39;t criticize because I&#39;ve never felt that we should compare movies to books--they are different media--unless the plot is badly compromised.  This one is not.  I remember being really pleased as a young viewer that Christie is able to bring all issues to a resolution in a believable and realistic way--no hidden doors--no strange interventions.  She is able to do this even in her lesser books.  Sometimes it is preferable to not be open ended, leaving unfinished details.  I relish this author and the movies and movie portrayals of her books.I also need to mention the music.  The score is so carefully tuned to the actions of the characters.  The black and white photography lends itself well to the oppressiveness of the setting where the characters find themselves.  You definitely should see this film."
tt0094669,175. Appointment with Death,6.1,1988,7200.0,1h 42m,PG,"Agatha Christie&#39;s Appointment With Death is not her best book, but is well crafted and a pleasant read. This adaptation isn&#39;t terrible, but it is the weakest of Peter Ustinov&#39;s outings as Poirot. Speaking of Ustinov, he is excellent here, I had no problem with him. And Lauren Bacall, Carrie Fisher, Jenny Seagrove and John Gielgud give fine support. The film does have some splendid locations, even if Petra was changed to Jerusalem if I remember rightly, and the music was good too. However, the script isn&#39;t that polished, a lot is changed from the book and some of the changes are underdeveloped, the character of Hassan was unnecessary. But my main gripe with the movie was the character of Mrs Boynton. The same applies for the recent David Suchet version(which was more unfaithful but better musically and visually, and the acting was more solid in that one too), the character of Mrs Boynton was never done quite right, despite the wholly hateable portrayal given by Piper Laurie. In the book, she is a bit of a tyrant, in the adaptation, she was portrayed as nasty and cantankerous, but lacked the depth of the character in the book. Overall, not bad, but I did think Death on the Nile and Evil Under The Sun were better. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0098454,176. Ten Little Indians,4.7,1989,1800.0,1h 40m,PG,"I find it quite hard to review this film, it&#39;s one of those I got into as a kid, and it&#39;s always difficult to be mean about your childhood films.The book, is perhaps my all time favourite novel, so it&#39;s pretty difficult to do it badly, or is it? There have been several adaptations, 1945, 1965 and 1974&#39;s versions were all different, but no matter how much they veered from the script they all managed to retain the suspense and sense of claustrophobia, aided both by direction, and more basically the locations. The Jungle setting doesn&#39;t really work on the same level somehow.The sets look pretty cheap, as do some of the costumes, Frank Stallone, Brenda and Sarah look pretty tatty in some parts.It&#39;s not all doom and gloom though, some of the acting is rather good, and whilst I don&#39;t particularly like some of the characters the acting is not at fault. Donald Pleasence is the high point, he is particularly good, Herbert Lom is good too, even though I loathed his character. I thought Sarah Maur Thorp was fair as Vera, she had an English delicacy.Some actors were rather badly cast, firstly, Yehuda Efroni is actually irritating as the Doctor, I couldn&#39;t wait for him to go. As for Frank Stallone I can think of no other reason for him to be there other then for his beefy looks, he does lots of intense pouts, but adds little. The Rogers were the worst culprits for overacting.I struggle to believe how &#39;Owen&#39; could have committed some of the murders, they seem a little far fetched, Mr Rogers in particular, although I enjoyed the finale, it&#39;s well acted and there is a sense of terror.I long for the day when someone sticks to the original ending, if only a producer would have the bottle.It&#39;s a fun film, a bit cheap, but some interesting surprises in store for the first time viewer, I still enjoy it despite its flaws 5/10"
tt0087852,177. Ordeal by Innocence,5.1,1984,1300.0,1h 30m,PG-13,"This 1984 version of Ordeal By Innocence doesn&#39;t just fail as an adaptation, it also fails on its own terms too, the latter of which I always try to base my opinion of a film on. There are two adaptations(as far as I&#39;m aware) of Ordeal By Innocence, this and the Geraldine McEwan adaptation. Neither really do the story justice and have similar problems to each other, but the McEwan version probably gives its actors more to do. The story is not perhaps masterpiece status, but it still has all the ingredients that make Agatha Christie so well worth reading. Just reading what it&#39;s about alone makes you want to engross yourself in the book and also watch an adaptation of it. Ordeal By Innocence is not a complete disaster. It does look good, it&#39;s well shot, slick and the costumes and sets are very handsome. Christopher Plummer is appropriately wry, Cassie Stuart is just lovely and lights up the film and while Faye Dunnaway deserved much more than a 2-3 cameo appearance she is quite memorable as a character who&#39;s easy to hate. However, while the cast is a who&#39;s who and were good on paper they don&#39;t have much to do. Donald Sutherland is rather workmanlike and Ian McShane brings some wit to his role but is given little to work with, while Annette Crosbie Sarah Miles are wasted and Michael Elphick- looking miserable with one of the worst Scottish accents I&#39;ve ever heard on film- is embarrassingly bad. It&#39;s not surprising that most of the cast didn&#39;t register, because the characters are sketchy and not developed well at all. You have a vague sense of what their roles in the story are but little more than that, so it makes the audience find it difficult to properly care. The dialogue, when we could hear it, lacked flow and felt very flat. Same with the direction. The story is a great one, but told in this film confusingly and ploddingly with next to no suspense or life, and that is including the ending(further disadvantaged by the murderer being revealed way too early). So much so that I had a temptation to watch something else, something I don&#39;t want to feel from an Agatha Christie adaptation. And the music is just awful, overbearing and of the films I&#39;ve seen recently it is by far the most out of place score I&#39;ve heard for any film since watching 1965&#39;s Ten Little Indians(a film I actually liked). Overall, disappointing. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0067052,178. Endless Night,6.0,1972,2600.0,1h 35m,Not Rated,"Around 45 years ago, when I was just a young lad, Hayley Mills was my favorite actress, and her 1962 film &quot;In Search of the Castaways&quot; was my favorite film, but between this and that, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen Hayley in anything since 1965&#39;s &quot;That Darn Cat.&quot; How nice, then, to see her, the other night, at age 26 in the 1972 British film &quot;Endless Night,&quot; and to realize what a nubile nymph my old flame had turned into later in life! In this adaptation of a 1967 Agatha Christie novel, Hayley plays Ellie Thomsen, the 6th richest girl in the world, who, after one date with pretty-boy chauffeur Michael (excellently portrayed by Welsh actor Hywel Bennett), elopes with him and builds his dream house in the Herts countryside. It is hard to figure out what words best describe &quot;Endless Night.&quot; It is not really a horror movie, or a love story, or a thriller, but certainly does have elements of all these types. The picture IS remarkably atmospheric, in no small measure due to yet another wonderfully evocative score by the great Bernard Herrmann, and should manage to baffle most viewers who are trying to figure out just where the story line is going. Besides the fine work by its two leads, veterans George Sanders (here in one of his last roles, and playing what his character self-describes as a &quot;desiccated old poop&quot;) and Lois Maxwell add sterling support, and even Britt Ekland turns in a convincing performance as Ellie&#39;s tutor/companion. Throw in some gorgeous scenery in the Herts and Positano countrysides, a surprise final quarter hour that manages to subvert everything we thought we knew, and two or three mild scares and you&#39;ve got yourself one very interesting entertainment. Kudos, indeed, to writer/director Sidney Gilliat! I just hope that I&#39;m not foolish enough to wait another 40 years before watching Hayley Mills in another picture. Perhaps it&#39;s time for me to finally check out Hayley and Hywel in 1968&#39;s &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot;...IF it ever gets released on DVD!"
tt0279250,179. Murder on the Orient Express,5.1,2001,1200.0,1h 40m,,"It is Alfred Molina&#39;s great misfortune that, in portraying Hercule Poirot, he has been preceded by Peter Ustinov, Albert Finney, and David Suchet. Had this not been true, we might have been tempted to give his performance a higher rating than it is now possible to do.The original novel by Agatha Christie (same title) is one of the greatest whodunits ever penned. For unknown reasons, Ustinov never did it. My guess is that, although his Poirot films were made after the timely death of the pernicious and much-despised Code, the prospect of a murderer getting away with the crime was still too daunting for Hollywood. Suchet has yet to make Orient, but then it was only last year (&#39;07) that he finally did &quot;Mrs. McGinty&#39;s Dead&quot; (with, we hope, Ariadne Oliver). Suchet&#39;s voice is used for Poirot in the 2006 Orient Express video game.So finally, in 2001 a TV version of Orient is made with Alfred Molina in the key role. Alas. Molina is a talented actor. His portrayal of Poirot, while not definitive nor even close, is passable  even pretty good in some ways. However, once we compare him with his predecessors (not to mention the literary original), the problems show up like fat, pendulous, juicy pimples (the kind we all loved to pop back in the day). We all know, for instance, that Poirot was fastidious to the point of school-marmish fussiness. Molina&#39;s Poirot is neat and that&#39;s about it. Molina&#39;s accent is a sort of generalized European, not the pointedly confrontational French that Poirot affected. Molina does use the catch-phrase &quot;little grey cells&quot;, but he rattles them out because they&#39;re in the script, not because (as is the case) Poirot is obsessive about them. Indeed, Poirot&#39;s fundamentally obsessive character is de-emphasized to the point of vanishing. Molin&#39;a Poirot seldom speaks of himself in the third person; Poirot does so rather a lot. His mustache is some short hair under his nose; Poirot&#39;s is a fashion statement and accessory that defines his dandified appearance. Molina doesn&#39;t wear gloves. Nor spats, but then the date of the mystery has been moved up to about the date the film was made. Anyone who by now believes I haven&#39;t made my case doesn&#39;t know Hercule.While Suchet is the best Poirot overall, Ustinov bears away the palm for best actor. He inhabits the role so effectively that we become unconscious of his imposing height and bulk. Finney, who appears in the 1974 Orient, lacks for little in the Poirotishness of his portrayal. This is a competition that Molina simply can&#39;t win.The plot of the 2001 film is, incidentally, pretty much the same as that of the novel and the 1974 film. Poirot is traveling from Istanbul on the famous Orient Express. He shares the first class car with a diverse set of individuals. One of them, a highly unpleasant person (Ratchett) is stabbed to death in the dead of night. There are plenty of clues  in fact, as Finney&#39;s Poirot observes and Molina&#39;s does not, there are too many of them. The train is stalled in its journey (snow slide in 1974, rock slide in 2001) and the railway&#39;s CEO commissions Poirot to find the killer. Through patient questioning and separating false clues from real ones, Poirot does so  twice. If you don&#39;t actually know the plot already, your cultural deprivation is truly unfortunate.The problem with the 2001 production, however, runs deeper than merely the star. It&#39;s virtually the whole cast and what the update in time has done to their roles. The update from 1935 to c.2001 was apparently made because the producers figured that education has been so inadequate recently that viewers would never figure out what a White Russian (Princess Dragomirov) is, nor understand references to the Lindburgh kidnapping, nor fail to be puzzled by people going to Iraq for actual constructive purposes (archaeology), nor  well, you get the gist.The result is that we have characters who are updated but far less interesting. As for the participating actors: recall that in 1974 we get Martin Balsam, Richard Widmark, Wendy Hiller, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, Michael York, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Perkins, John Gielgud,  well, again you get the gist. Want a cast list of the 2001 film? Well, there&#39;s Leslie Caron, and Who? and Whom? and What? and Which? and and and  well, and a group of actors, most of whom are still working. They appear primarily in small roles in TV series episodes and in fairly little-known films. The upshot is that we get OK performances of a fairly uninspired script, and that&#39;s about it. The exception is from the one fine actor in the group, Leslie Caron. That&#39;s the upside. The downside is that her performance is deeply informed by that of Wendy Hiller as Princess Dragomirov. In this film the character becomes Señora Alvarado, the widow of a fairly nasty Latin American dictator. The problem here is that the character has way more social standing than would someone coming from such a sleazy background. She is in fact treated as the royalty Dragomirov was. That is, the character doesn&#39;t really compute  in order to keep character relationships as they were before the rewrite, Alvarado had to be accorded deference even Eva Peron didn&#39;t get in exile. Still, Caron manages to convince us of her bona fides. As I said, she&#39;s good.The cold, hard fact is that there are quite a few things on TV that are better than this remake. That&#39;s something we can&#39;t say about the 1974 original. The Poirot of the remake, Alfred Molina, is a pretty good actor  but for whatever reason he has seriously misconceived the part he plays and as Poirot he winds up in 4th place in a field of 4. The picture, alas, winds up in about 9th place in a field of 2."
tt0117282,180. The Pale Horse,6.2,1997,444.0,,,"Taken from the 1961 novel of the same name, this Anglia TV rendition of The Pale Horse was filmed in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Oxon, and London. Notable differences from the novel are the absence of Ariadne Oliver and some of the other characters from the book.The story concerns young sculptor Mark Easterbrook (Colin Buchanan) who discovers a priest dying from a head wound-the man gives Mark a list of names before he dies. The police don&#39;t exactly believe Mark&#39;s story, even to the point where they suspect him in the priest&#39;s death, but Mark determines to follow up the list-which leads to other murders before he finally solves it with the aid of Kate Mercer (Jayne Ashbourne), a friend of one of the victims.The Pale Horse is nothing superlative, rather more like average, and the two young leads are somewhat bland. The good things about this production are the photography, and very fine performances from Sir Leslie Phillips and Michael Byrne-that alone makes it worth watching. Martin Kennedy is also quite good in the small part of Tate, a tough henchman. Jean Marsh plays one of the three witches who reside at the house known as The Pale Horse."
tt0086287,181. Seven Dials Mystery,6.6,1981,880.0,2h 12m,Not Rated,"Sly vixen that she was, Agatha Christie had other arrows in her quiver besides her usual crew of detectives.For instance, &quot;The Seven Dials Mystery&quot; is a beautiful filmed production set among the magnificent houses of the great if not so good between the two World Wars, far from the tranquil world of Miss Marple.There is no middle-aged Belgian detective or village busybody here, but a pert girl with impeccable breeding and a nose for adventure. In &quot;The Seven Dials Mystery,&quot; originally written in 1929, and produced as a British TV film in 1981 (directed by long-time &quot;NCIS&quot; director Tony Wharmby) , Christie&#39;s sleuth is a young noblewoman named Lady Eileen &quot;Bundle&quot; Brent (Cheryl Campbell) . Just a few years older than Nancy Drew, this delightful daughter of a marquess (Sir John Gielgud!) engages in some very clever (and very dangerous) detective work.Set in a gorgeous old pile, and involving a whole House of Lords of wealthy aristocrats, including several very rich and (sigh!) very stupid gilded youth, &quot;The Seven Dials Mystery&quot; has plot enough for a dozen mystery movies. During the day, Bright Young Things screaming, &quot;By Jove!&quot; and &quot;I say!&quot; play away the hours. But as mysterious gunshots ring out at night, to the grim accompaniment of ancient clocks tolling away the hours, the bodies begin to add up. As the cute &quot;Bundle&quot; Brent tries to figure out what&#39;s going on, Dame Agatha adds still more layers of mystery to the puzzle, and what started out as almost a day trip to the Fun House becomes a terrifying excursion into the unknown.Along for the ride is the great Sir John Gielgud, in a charming, often hilarious performance as an eccentric peer of the realm (he easily steals every scene he&#39;s in), and the marvelous Harry Andrews, as, of course, a Detective-Superintendent from Scotland Yard.Christie doesn&#39;t let you off lightly, and there are nuances and subtleties that you might miss on your first viewing. So watch &quot;Seven Dials Mystery&quot; over and over, and don&#39;t look at the clock while the movie&#39;s playing, because Dame Agatha has a surprise for you every minute of the film."
tt0103078,182. Miss Marple: They Do It with Mirrors,7.1,1991,2000.0,1h 40m,,"I truly love Joan Hickson&#39;s adaptations of Miss Marple, she is in my opinion the quintessential Jane Marple. It&#39;s one of my lesser favourites in the series. I&#39;ll try and explain why.The novel itself isn&#39;t one of my favourites, I find the trickery of the murder works better in the book (in my mind) then it does on screen. In terms of production I find it safe, but still very good, when compared to other adaptations it&#39;s quite not there.On the plus side the acting is superb, Hickson is as always excellent, Holly Aird is wonderfully youthful and vibrant as Gina. The legendary Jean Simmons is incredibly sweet, she gave a sensitive and believable performance of the fragile Carrie Louise. I am a bit biased when it comes to Joss Ackland, he is hugely charismatic, at times almost overpoweringly so, but here we see a restrained, dare I say touching performance, his voice makes him incredibly watchable.The scene I enjoyed most of all I think was the stage play, Ruth looks on awkwardly, Miss Marple watches intently. It&#39;s there to show that events are sometimes smoke and mirrors, it&#39;s cleverly put together. I also like their later fireside chat where she talks about the robberies committed by starting the bonfires early.I would still give it a score of 8/10, it is still an excellent production, it&#39;s just that I have such high regards for others in the series. I must say I find the later Marple a particularly good production from a frequently bemoaned series."
tt0244901,183. The Diamond Hunters,4.6,2001,417.0,,R,"THE DIAMOND HUNTERS is a 2001 miniseries based on the &#39;70s novel of the same name by popular adventure writer Wilbur Smith. This version of the tale was shot in South Africa as an international collaboration. These days, the only commercially available version of it seems to be the shortened film version, missing some 70 minutes, which I caught playing on television.I&#39;ve actually had the pleasure of reading the source material for this one - Smith is one of my favourite authors so I was intrigued to see what the creators would make of his story. The answer is that they&#39;ve ruined it, turning it into a cheesy soap instead of the hard-edged thriller that I read and loved.The storyline is dragged out endlessly even in this shortened film version of the miniseries. It seems to take forever to get anywhere and to cover material that only took up a couple of chapters in the novel. Roy Schieder is an odd choice for a pivotal role which screams miscasting, while Alyssa Milano gets a ton of screen time in a role which was small and quite extraneous in the book. As the feuding brothers, Sean Patrick Flanery and Michael Easton aren&#39;t very good either, both coming across as quite wooden.THE DIAMOND HUNTERS jettisons Smith&#39;s rich dialogue of the novel in favour of cheesy, soap opera style dialogue scenes. It only starts to pick up in the second half, but even this lacks the sense of danger and excitement that was so prevalent in the novel. I think that even I could do a more authentic - and enjoyable - adaptation given the resources..."

He&#39;s the Road Runner to Kolldehoff&#39;s Wily Coyote. During the first half of the film, it plays just like a road runner cartoon.When war is declared however, Kolldehoff crosses into British territory where Marvin has operated with sanctuary and exacts a terrible vengeance for being constantly made a fool of. On Marvin, on Moore, and on Barbara Parkins, Marvin&#39;s daughter who Moore has now married and had a child with.This is World War I so the Germans aren&#39;t behaving like the Nazis of the second World War. But Kolldehoff you can see a potential recruit for Hitler in the post war years. In fact I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an accident that Kolldehoff and his character Fleischer look very much like German Field Marshal Ludendorff who was sympathetic to the early Nazi party.Shout at the Devil is a broad comic adventure for the first half and turns serious in the second half. Moore and Marvin have a nice easy chemistry between them, Marvin is reaching back to his Cat Ballou days and the bag of scene stealing tricks he used to get an Oscar. Moore is hard pressed, but does keep up.And who doesn&#39;t like a live road runner cartoon."
tt0073247,185. The Kingfisher Caper,4.6,1975,120.0,1h 26m,PG,"This sporadically engaging action melodrama was prepared as a feature film for television in South Africa before that internationally beleaguered nation was forced into a state of anarchy, and was aired within the United Kingdom and the United States shortly after its completion, with the action set in and about Capetown, and making appropriate use of that venue&#39;s picturesque quality in addition to its significant diamond industry. The film&#39;s graceless assembly of scenes is composed of two primary segments, thoroughly disparate in their natures. A prominent &quot;diamond man&quot; and corporation executive, Hendrich Van Der Byl (Bill McNaught), after being informed by his doctor that he is soon to die, bequeaths his extensive properties and other assets evenly to his son Benedict (David McCallum), daughter Tracy (Hayley Mills), along with his adopted son Johnny (Jon Cypher), with Benedict selected as new director of the firm. Unfortunately for the other two, Benedict is hungry to acquire ultimate power with the company, hoping to ingurgitate the resources left to his sister and foster brother, among these being the latter&#39;s diamond dredging craft Kingfisher. When his hopes to completely take over through guile and cunning are obviously not about to succeed, Benedict decides upon more violent means with which he may achieve his goals. The film&#39;s initial portion is the more interesting, as emotions of the three principals are undressed, but when violent action comes to the fore in the storyline, the work is converted into a routine time-passer, although the striking location of Capetown adds pictorial splendour. There are numerous sequences depicting methods by which diamond dredging from shoals is achieved, of principal interest, perhaps, solely to engineers, being simply an example of the fading fount of creativity evidenced within Roy Boulting&#39;s final screenplay. Boulting&#39;s wife, Mills, is top billed, but it is McCallum who earns acting laurels with an intense performance in this choppily cut film that is further burdened with a grating big band score contributed by John Dankworth."
tt0071566,186. Gold,5.7,1974,2700.0,2h 4m,PG,"I was very surprised when I saw this film. After all, by the time they made &quot;Gold&quot;, South Africa was already being roundly condemned by many nations for its apartheid policies. In fact, soon film projects in the country would be a thing of the past and the fact that American and British actors appeared in the film and that much of it was filmed in South Africa surprised me. Perheps, however, they studio chose such a project because it really made the mine operators look like scum...and thereby was a criticism, indirectly, of apartheid.The bosses at a gold mine in South Africa have a reprehensible scheme. They know that an underground lake is very close to one of their mines. And, if they accidentally drill too close, it will flood the mine and kill a lot of workers. BUT, it will also make the price of gold shoot to the moon...making them even richer! The problem is that the General Manager of the mine is killed in a mining accident and they trust that the new GM, Rod Slater (Roger Moore) will play along with their scheme. As for Slater, what he seems mostly interested in during most of the film is stupping the boss&#39; wife (Susannah York).To me, a major defect in the picture is spending so much time on the affair. First, it really didn&#39;t make a lot of sense. Second, it really had little to do with the plot. Third, it just seemed like a lot of padding. And, fourth, you really don&#39;t care about these two...other than, perhaps, seeing it as a chance for Slater to do to his boss&#39; wife what the boss plans on doing to everyone else!Overall, a rather pedestrian handling of material that could have been a lot better. Not a bad film...but not a very good one either.By the way, I have been to South Africa twice--spending about a month there. One thing I loved about the country were the lovely accents...none of which I heard during the course of &quot;Gold&quot;!"
tt0062863,187. Dark of the Sun,6.8,1968,3700.0,1h 40m,Approved,"A nasty and terrific gem of an action movie, the best of Rod Taylor&#39;s career.  Very exciting, expertly acted, and with a beautiful score that sounds like it was done by Maurice Jarre (it wasn&#39;t).  Highly recommended."
tt0251114,188. Hart's War,6.4,2002,57000.0,2h 5m,R,"This takes place in a POW camp during WWII, and follows the events that transpire after a few black enlisted men are captured and put among the white prisoners. This has a well-written script, lines are great and well-delivered, the plot is interesting, engaging and develops quite nicely throughout. The editing and cinematography have some inspired moments, and are always marvelous. This is rather exciting and entertaining.I haven&#39;t read the novel, nor did I realize that this was based upon one until I watched it. This is the third of Hoblit&#39;s films I&#39;ve seen, the other two being Frequency and Primal Fear, both of which I find to be excellent. Thus, in comparison, this is a little less impressive. I wouldn&#39;t call it poor, however. It certainly has a point to it, something to say, and it communicates it fairly well. The message is good, too.The performances are impeccable, Willis does as well as we expect, Farrell makes reasonable use of his chance at doing a role that can prove he can do more than project his &quot;bad boy&quot; persona onto the screen, and Howard shines. This meeting and conflict between the experienced master and the up-and-coming student is further infused with the clever juxtaposition of that relationship being not only of their characters – but of the actors, as well.The DVD comes with two informational, compelling and amusing commentaries: one by Gregory Hoblit, writer Billy Ray and Bruce Willis, and one by producer David Foster, 10 minutes of good deleted scenes with or without director commentary and several photo galleries. There is relatively infrequent strong violence and language. I recommend this to any fan of dramas, and who enjoy movies that deal with history. 7/10"
tt0089572,189. The Mean Season,6.1,1985,5600.0,1h 43m,R,"Decent enough movie, with an absolutely menacing performance by Richard Jordan as the sick, deluded serial killer.Kurt Russell was...just okay. I couldn&#39;t quite figure out what he was getting at. He was burnt out in his job with the newspaper in Miami. He seemed to be craving just the situation that he found himself in. Conversing with a serial killer, and writing about it; Having a literal front row seat at the story of the year; being the central figure in a national story; &quot;approaching pulitzer territory&quot;. However, Russell erupted into attitude with just about everybody he came into contact with. At one point, he&#39;s smugly satisfied to have found himself to be so deeply involved in an emerging story of a sadistic serial killer, then he snaps at the killer when events aren&#39;t turning out favorably. This doesn&#39;t seem like the emotional response you would expect from a seasoned reporter. A serial killer is doing something like this just to play with the heads of authority. To expect him to behave rationally is naive and foolish.However, Russell gamely does generally well with the character, and there are effectively troubling and suspenseful aspects to the film. The subject of newspaper ethics is broached and discussed, although I&#39;m not sure all that effectively.Andy Garcia, Richard Bradford and Richard Masur were excellent.Mariel Hemingway was absolutely terrible. She either was giggling, looking completely bewildered, or hysterical. Granted, the script gave her little else to do, but a creative actress could have made something out of it. She completely distracted me every time she was on screen. Just a terrible job.All in all, a decent, flawed movie with a first-rate performance by Jordan. He made the movie worth it."
tt0113501,190. Just Cause,6.4,1995,31000.0,1h 42m,R,"Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film.Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former Assistant District Attorney, Kate Capshaw and he&#39;s a crusader against capital punishment. Blair Underwood&#39;s grandmother Ruby Dee buttonholes Connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson&#39;s appeal. He&#39;s sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl.When Connery arrives in this rural Florida county he&#39;s up against a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne who&#39;s about as ruthless in his crime solving as Orson Welles was in Touch of Evil. Later on after Connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he&#39;s uncovered, he&#39;s feeling pretty good about himself. At that point the film takes a decided turn from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear.To say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly. The cast uniformly turns in some good performances. Special mention must be made of Ed Harris who plays a Hannibal Lecter like serial killer on death row with Underwood. He will make your skin crawl and he starts making Connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises he&#39;s been basing his convictions on. Many a confirmed liberal I&#39;ve known has come out thinking quite differently once they&#39;ve become a crime victim.Of course the reverse is equally true. Many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteed.Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and a never ending one at that for all society. I guess if Just Cause has a moral that would probably be it."
tt0086442,191. A Time to Die,4.3,1982,310.0,1h 31m,R,"Michael Rogan sets out for revenge against six men who interrogated him post WW2, Germany. Where also his pregnant wife was captured, tortured and murdered when he wouldn&#39;t comply in giving them the information they wanted. A creaky, so-so revenge drama that is quite laboured on every front. For these revenge stories to come off, there needs to be some sort of emotional attachment or pull, but the material along with Edward Albert Jr&#39;s limited performance fail to do so. So in the end there&#39;s really no impact to it all. Watching him calculate and then dispatching these men (led by Rex Harrison) was rather dry and uneventful. While durable in its craftmanship and scope, this didn&#39;t stop the execution coming off rather plain in its sense of action. The basic formula is there, but a real lack of excitement and suspense shows it up with a slowly progressive script and so does some disjointed editing. For most part it&#39;s terribly dreary and seedy. The European location work is well captured though, giving it some colour and Rod Taylor along with Rex Harrison gives it a bit of class and edge."
tt0093966,192. The Sicilian,5.4,1987,5700.0,1h 55m,R,"For entertainment value, Cimino&#39;s &#39;The Sicilian&#39; does not deliver in the Hollywood sense. That&#39;s good in my opinion.It viewed some where between documentary and romantic fairy tale. Maybe to many, the latter choice would be more appropriate. I&#39;d place Sicilian, Salvatore Giuliano or Lambert&#39;s portrayal smack in the middle. That&#39;s because even after doing much research I&#39;m still not sure who the real character was. Probably, no one really knows for sure.The plot moves along fine except for the opening flashback from Turturro&#39;s cell. Cimino should have axed the scene first cut. The inclusion of the American governess did not help the story line either. In fact, she, the actress gave an unconvincing and unflattering portrayal of Americans (the rich ones) living abroad. At times she swore like a trooper. Most of the film she sounded and looked like a hooker in communist garb, designer that is. I was so glad when she fell off the reel.The rest of supporting cast was complementary. Giuliano&#39;s accomplices were good enough and just bad enough to add intrigue. Even the crotchety old professor was a good fit as interlocutor between Giuliano, his loyal band of unhappy bandits, the fickle mob and the stripe changing church.The film&#39;s one weakness is the behind the scene&#39;s love affair between the Mafia Don and Giuliano. I found it confusing. Do competing mobsters profess such unrequited love? Perhaps they do in Sicily.If you&#39;re looking for something in the genre of the non-stop murderous mobster films, then give this one a miss. However, if you are fascinated with Sicily and their mysterious culture, &#39;The Sicilian&#39; will give you some good glimpses of the stunning mountain terrain, cosmopolitan Palermo and its people both big and small, good and bad."
tt0087089,193. The Cotton Club,6.6,1984,20000.0,2h 9m,R,"Part fictional and part non-fictional, this lavish two-hour Francis Ford Coppola film spotlights the Cotton Club, the legendary, real-life Harlem jazz nightclub that flourished in the Prohibition era of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Richard Gere plays Dixie Dwyer, a young musician who works for mobsters, in an effort to advance his career. Dwyer falls in love with Vera Cicero (Diane Lane), the girlfriend of gangster Dutch Schultz (James Remar). The Dwyer character is based loosely on real-life jazz trumpet player Bix Beiderbecke.Throughout the film, various gangsters and bootleggers interact, sometimes violently, but much of the action centers around the Cotton Club, an establishment owned in real-life by Owney Madden, played in the film by actor Bob Hoskins. Madden would bring in Black performers to entertain a Whites-only clientèle, a truly racist policy, and a major plot point in the film&#39;s story.The film&#39;s plot is somewhat muddled, the result of a less than stellar screenplay. And, as you would expect, the gangster characters are not terribly likable. But the film overcomes these script weaknesses with a captivating visual and musical style that is both tawdry and elegant. The corruption, the violence, and the implied sleaze are garish and tawdry to be sure. Yet, the Club&#39;s ambiance gushes with a certain elegance and glamour. It&#39;s a strange mix, but one that is entirely consistent with that era in U.S. history.The film gets points from me for its lush, period piece costumes and production design, and adroit lighting, as well as all those jazz numbers, both sultry and flashy. Gregory Hines together with brother Maurice Hines provide some snappy tap dancing, some of which is improvised. Interestingly, their grandmother really did perform at the Cotton Club during its heyday. Also of interest in the film, viewers get to watch towering Fred Gwynne, who plays Frenchy, the oh-so-serious assistant to Owney Madden; the two of them engage in some interesting dialogue.Although the script&#39;s story and characters are less than ideal, I enjoyed the film a lot, mostly as a result of the tawdry and elegant visual style combined with the lavish jazz numbers. If you&#39;re interested in gangster movies or the Prohibition era of American history, this film is a must-see."
tt1340800,194. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,7.0,2011,220000.0,2h 7m,R,"Atmosphere: superb. Acting: outstanding. Cinematography: wonderful. Soundtrack: very nice. Still, I didn&#39;t like this film. And that&#39;s because of its only weak point: the storyline. I have never read the book it is based on, nor seen the television series, and I completely lost track of the intricacies of the plot. I had only a vague idea of what was going on, where the story was headed and what the time perspective was (indications of the years in the flashbacks would be helpful). I watched this movie late on a Friday night after a busy working week, so maybe I wasn&#39;t as sharp as I should be. You have to be absolutely concentrated every single second to understand everything that happens in this film. Perhaps the movie was not meant to be crystal clear, and perhaps the director wants the viewer to discover all the subtleties after a second or third viewing. But then you are left with lots of scenes in which middle-aged men with stiff upper lips exchange what seems to be incomprehensible inside information. The lack of much real action might be a plus for viewers who like serious films, but it&#39;s a disadvantage when you lose track of what is actually happening."
tt0059749,195. The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,7.5,1965,20000.0,1h 52m,Approved,"Having just read LeCarré&#39;s first novel, &#39;Call for the Dead&#39;, I am now appreciating his third novel &#39;The Spy Who Came in From the Cold&#39; even more. This film adaptation directed by Martin Ritt is a fine preamble to the masterful BBC series &#39;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&#39; and &#39;Smiley&#39;s People&#39;. One of the joys of LeCarré&#39;s novels is that many characters return again and again. Mundt, the &quot;villain&quot; in &#39;Spy...&#39; first appears in &#39;Call..&#39; and as usual LeCarré wraps up a few loose ends from the previous story. This black and white film recreates the sullen atmosphere of cold war espionage in a way that color seems to diminish for some unexplainable reason. Those were black and white kinda times in my memory. Depressing, frightening and dour.George Smiley makes a small appearance, albeit very important as a character in the plot line, and is nicely played by Rupert Davies, capturing the diffident and wry Smiley as effectively as Guinness did later on and Denholm Elliot even further on in the TV film &#39;A Murder of Quality&#39;. Cyril Cusack&#39;s Control could easily be the younger version of Alexander Knox&#39;s masterful rendition in the Smiley TV shows. The continuity suggested in all of these films is very satisfying. It&#39;s a shame so many of the other versions of LeCarré&#39;s novels are so mediocre... ie &#39;The Little Drummer Girl&#39; with a totally miscast Diane Keaton, and &#39;The Russia House&#39;, too Hollywood by half.Richard Burton turns in just about the greatest performance of his life here. He is the embodiment of the disillusioned, bitter and down-trodden ego-maniac that seems to be the basic cocktail for a spy&#39;s personality, according to LeCarré.I&#39;ve seen this film many times but just recently spotted LeCarré himself (at least it certainly looks like him) as an extra in a short scene. As Leamas is making his roundabout way to Smiley&#39;s house at 9 Bywater Street, he is exiting the first of 2 taxis. As he does so a tall, lean man in black is walking towards him. Ritt seems to be focusing the camera on this &quot;extra&quot; actor who actually makes furtive glances at Leamas. It is later revealed that Leamas has been followed by the Communists. Could LeCarré be playing that non-speaking, uncredited part of the Eastern &quot;watcher&quot; trailing Leamas to Smiley&#39;s house? Wouldn&#39;t surprise me in the least. It&#39;s a part LeCarré would have enjoyed playing, I think.And, like Hitchcock, LeCarré has appeared in film adaptations of his books before.Claire Bloom is excellent as the naive English communist who hasn&#39;t got a clue as to what she&#39;s supporting. The end of this film is always shocking to me. The ruthlessness of the spy-masters, the lies, the back-stabbing.... There is nothing over-blown in this film. It&#39;s all very subtle and intriguing and with the passage of time just gets more and more fascinating.Highly recommended to fans of this genre, especially LeCarré fanatics. If you haven&#39;t read his books you are missing out on perhaps the finest living writer of the English language. Some &quot;experts&quot; think his writing style is out of date because the plots are so involved and the prose so full of humor and political incorrectness; I read something to that effect in the most recent edition of the &#39;Halliwell&#39; guide. Perhaps the editor of that book has A.D.D. or something, or perhaps he&#39;s just seen to many glitzy, empty flicks designed to entertain the gawping masses, I don&#39;t know. To me, LeCarré will never go out of style and it is to be hoped the film adaptations of his books will continue to be made. A few remakes wouldn&#39;t be out of order either."
tt1972571,196. A Most Wanted Man,6.7,2014,83000.0,2h 2m,R,"A word of caution. It took three viewings of &#39;A Most Wanted Man&#39; for me to understand and fully appreciate the film. It&#39;s the film adaptation of the John LeCarre spy novel and, like many of his stories, it&#39;s many layered, many charactered. In short, very complicated, to say the least.Here&#39;s the story. There are two events being monitored by a team of German Intelligence Agents in present day Hamburg, a team led by Philip Seymour Hoffman&#39;s character Gunther. (1) An Arab doctor living in Hamburg may be sending money to a terrorist organization; money given to the doctor supposedly for charitable purposes. (2) A young Chechyn man has come to Hamburg to claim his dead father&#39;s fortune; he is Muslim and, as such, has been tortured by the Russians. The German Intelligence agents have devised a way to bring the two men together and somehow halt the money&#39;s being forwarded to terrorists.As this is LeCarre, nothing remains that simple. There are American Agents afoot with their own objectives. There are German Police Officials with plans of their own. There is a naive German Attorney (Rachel McAdams) looking out for the Chechyn&#39;s interests, and a banker (Willem DeFoe) who is necessary to bring the two men together.Hoffman is the heart of the film. His Gunther is a hard drinking, chain smoking, overweight and overwrought loner. He is playing the &#39;long game&#39;. Rather than rushing in and arresting everyone and anyone who might be related to terrorists, he wants to discover exactly how the money get transferred and to whom. He is looking to take down whoever sits at the very top of the terrorist pyramid.The question is, Will he? Will he have the time to do it?That&#39;s what the film&#39;s about, and it&#39;s definitely a worthwhile subject. And a worthwhile viewing.About Hoffman? A great loss. If you doubt it, I say, see this film."
tt0087629,197. The Little Drummer Girl,6.1,1984,2500.0,2h 10m,R,"This 1984 film based on John Le Carre&#39;s book could well have been written just a few days ago.  The confrontation between Israel and Palestine has not changed over the years although the explosive device chosen in the film happens to be a nasty bomb hidden in a suit case and detonated at a distance.  Much of the excitement of the story seems to revolve around the preparation and delivery of the suit cases and the spy and counter spy activities.My reason for choosing this film was to see more of the work of Klaus Kinski (an explosive personality if ever there was one) but in this film he was very much in control. In the role of Kurtz he is responsible for selecting Charlie (Diane Keaton) to spy among the Palestinians.  Charlie being a superb actress could handle the job expertly using her feminine charms.The film has a very large cast...too large in fact...and one tends to get lost amongst all the characters trying to remember which are the Israelis and which are the Palestinians.The film literally starts with a bang and the search is on to find the perpetrators.  As the tension mounts and the bombs explode, one keeps asking, &quot;Who will be next?&quot;One cannot visualize a happy ending for such a film.  While it makes exciting viewing the tragedy is that lives are still being lost each day as the confrontation continues and hopes of peace seem to become even more remote."
tt1995390,198. Our Kind of Traitor,6.3,2016,25000.0,1h 48m,R,"Sometimes you get into a situation without really doing anything. And then you have to ask yourself where to go from there. Something like this happens to Ewan McGregors character. Someone with a past, but also someone with morals. And someone who seems to be struggling with his life, so he may be welcoming whatever gets thrown at him.This is based on a novel which I haven&#39;t read, so I can&#39;t compare those two. I can tell you that the movie is more than suspenseful enough and it seems very much rooted in reality (of course heightened at certain points of the story). There are many obstacles and you may see a lot of things coming before they happen, but the movie is played very well and is more than decent enough to enjoy"
tt0061556,199. The Deadly Affair,6.7,1967,4400.0,1h 47m,Approved,"You&#39;ve been conversing with a man, later he&#39;s dead, a suicide, but you need to close the thread, so you visit his cold wife, find out more about his life, but the yarn is frayed, you can&#39;t put this to bed. You&#39;re resigned to make your own examinations, retired copper then assists, investigations, you pursue the clues, prepare, a cunning trap so you can snare, a red flag spy, using your guile, and circumspection.Even today it plants you back into the time of its enactment, you feel the frostiness of the times, as well as the emotional disconnection, encapsulated in a world of mistrust. James Mason plays a himself, as so often he did, Simone Signoret the unemotional widow, Harriet Andersson not in a Bergman film is a bit strange, and who&#39;d want to meet Harry Andrews on a dark, misty night if they&#39;d been up to no good."
tt0236784,200. The Tailor of Panama,6.1,2001,32000.0,1h 49m,R,"Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Harry, an Englishman with a sadly shady past who has re- invented himself in Panama as the best tailor in the country, making clothes for the rich and politically powerful. Into his world comes Osnard, played by Pierce Brosnan. A morally corrupt, self-serving MI6 spy, sent to Panama as a last chance after seducing a Euro diplomats wife. Many were bowled over by the irony of casting Brosnan, so associated with James Bond, as this much realer, creepier Bond alter ego. A man who is handsome, and self-confident, but whose endless seduction of women seems smarmy not sexy, and who delights in screwing other people while profiting himself. For me the casting was actually problematic. Brosnon&#39;s terrific, but the irony is so distractingly obvious, that it pulled me out of the story, and made me think too much about film and our hero images instead of simply accepting the character. Beyond that, Osnard is drawn a little too broadly for my taste. He&#39;s so transparent, I have a hard time he gets anyone to trust him even for a moment. If his inner self-serving pig were a bit better hidden, it might have given the audience more to unravel, and make other characters&#39; willingness to do his bidding a bit easier to buy. The mix of tones also was a bit of a misfire for me. Never quite darkly funny enough to ascend into true satire, but certainly never edgy enough to be taken seriously, there&#39;s a lack of danger here. Unlike &#39;Dr. Strangelove&#39;, we never really think Harry and Osnard&#39;s games will reduce Panama to a pile of rubble, and the intimation of it seems false and a bit silly. Yet, all that complaining is because the movie is good enough, smart enough, brave enough and entertaining enough that I felt frustrated it didn&#39;t quite work as brilliantly as is should. But I&#39;d certainly still recommend it, in spite of my long winded misgivings, and I&#39;m also willing to give it another look."
tt0066001,201. The Looking Glass War,5.8,1970,1500.0,1h 48m,M/PG,"Although undeniably the weakest of the three John Le Carre novels to be filmed during the 1960&#39;s this is not quite as bad some would have us believe. It proved to be one of only two features to be directed by Frank R. Pierson, the other being the third version of &#39;A Star is Born&#39;. The latter film at least made money despite a critical drubbing whereas this one failed on both counts.There are some redeeming features here, notably the cinematography of Austin Dempster and first class performances from Ralph Richardson, Paul Rogers, Robert Urquart and Anthony Hopkins who is slowly moving up the ranks. Hopkins freely admitted that his ambition was to be an international film star and in time would certainly be granted his wish!The weak link is Christopher Jones whose rather quirky personality at first appeals but then becomes rather tiresome. He is working through his James Dean complex here and in the role of a Pole is not very well dubbed. He was to be even more miscast in &#39;Ryan&#39;s Daughter&#39; which proved to be another nail in his coffin. Also disappointing is Pia Degermark as the love interest. Having shone in &#39;Elvira Madigan&#39; she is rather bland here and despite her off-screen relationship with Jones there is precious little chemistry.Even by the author&#39;s standards the material is pretty bleak and Mister Pierson alas is not in the same league as Messrs. Ritt and Lumet.Where it does succeed admirably is in depicting the soul-destroying and morally ambiguous nature of the Espionage business where human beings are nothing if not expendable.&quot;War is hell, Mr. Thornhill.

tt0102485,202. A Murder of Quality,6.3,1991,1000.0,1h 30m,,"This 1991 British production (Thames TV) for the A&amp;E channel is based on mystery writer John le Carre&#39;s second novel. Le Carre wrote the screenplay for &quot;A Murder of Quality,&quot; so the necessary changes for filming were made by the book&#39;s author himself. It&#39;s interesting that this is the only story with le Carre&#39;s character, George Smiley, that is set outside the field of espionage. A number of British actors have played George Smiley in movies made on le Carre&#39;s books. They all are very good. Denholm Elliott has the role in this film. He plays a more reserved, humble character than usual. Glenda Jackson is excellent as his friend from espionage days, Alisa Brimley. Joss Ackland is very good as Terence Fielding, a school headmaster. And, Matthew Scurfield is very good as Inspector Rigby. The rest of the supporting cast all are quite good. While this story has the usual red herring or two, it wasn&#39;t difficult for me to guess early on who the culprit was. The film even seemed to make it easy with one scene in particular. While I haven&#39;t read many mystery novels of the past few decades, I do enjoy the movies based on works by mystery writers. Besides le Carre, John Grisham and others are still writing today. But no one, in my estimation, will ever top Agatha Christie as a crime and mystery writer. Her super sleuth, Hercule Poirot, remains the most beguiling of all crime solvers, in my book. Since the early 1960s, I have read and/or watched the films on all of Christie&#39;s works that have been printed or put on film. Only once was I able to guess correctly early on who the culprit was.Still, one can&#39;t have caviar, clams casino, lobster, and crepes Suzette all the time. Those are all the more enjoyable on special occasions, after many more meals of good but wholesome everyday meals. So, a movie based on a le Carre novel is enjoyable and satisfying at any time. Most movie buffs should enjoy &quot;A Murder of Quality.&quot;"
tt0100530,203. The Russia House,6.1,1990,19000.0,2h 3m,R,"The Russia House is a superior spy romance movie which falls short of being great. Additionally a couple of factors have been unkind to it over time.Connery and Pfeiffer are excellant; the large cast are almost uniformly outstanding (except perhaps Roy Scheider, who I usually like, but who seems a bit over the top in his role here); the Moscow scenery and end of the Cold War feel are great, and the main characters are easy to like, if difficult to outright love.  On the down side the writing assumes too much in expecting the audience to stay on top of the espionage jargon and intrigue, added to the non-linear plot. Let your attention wander and you&#39;ll lose your way. If it had been a little easier to follow, it would have left more room for dramatic tension, which was adequate but seldom riveting.
When I said that time has been unkind to The Russia House, I meant two things: firstly that the unfortunate timing of the movie&#39;s release, a year before the collapse of the Soviet Union, ensured that it would be dated almost immediately. More significantly, a growing portion of the film&#39;s potential audience didn&#39;t live through the late Soviet Era, and the nuances of concepts like Glasnost, and why Perestroika makes it hard  for Pfeiffer to do her shoe-shopping aren&#39;t going to mean a thing to anyone much under 30.But that&#39;s not the movie&#39;s fault. Russia House is still a  quality, enjoyable drama with a great cast, even if it&#39;s somewhat ponderous and slow-moving, and complex. And oh yes - it has James Fox. A film like this without James Fox would have been like a table with three legs.7 out of 10"
tt1205537,204. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,6.2,2014,141000.0,1h 45m,PG-13,"It&#39;s ironic that &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; is part of the title for this one because this is the furthest from the character that any of the films have been. Beyond a some what similar back-story, the doctor soon to be wife, and that he works for the CIA, Ryan is not Ryan. They turn him more into a spy/field agent than the brainy analyst that he&#39;s meant to be. As a result, there is nothing in this movie that makes it stand out from the rest of it&#39;s genre. It&#39;s just another spy movie with an over the top villain that&#39;s plotting world domination. It&#39;s predictable and generic. They sacrificed what made the Jack Ryan character unique. I&#39;m not saying that the movie didn&#39;t work as some Bond/Bourne/Mission Impossible wannabe with bits and pieces slapped together from every spy thriller ever made. It captured successful elements from those films pretty well. It&#39;s just a shame that they relied on recycling tired and over used narrative when there is still a bunch of great Ryan books that they have yet to adapt. There should be no reason to slap together this films story when a much more talented writer like Clancy still has more stories to draw from. I agree with Peter Travers comment &quot;It&#39;s a product constructed out of spare parts and assembled with computerized precision.&quot;Despite following a predictable formula very closely instead of the source material, the movie still works as entertainment. Chris Pine is great, despite the writers failing him, and he really carries the movie. He could be a great Jack Ryan if they actually wrote the character correctly. Branagh delivers a pretty good villain, even though he&#39;s more suited for a Bond film. There are a couple of scenes that deliver good suspense. It&#39;s just not a Jack Ryan movie. It seems that they only used Jack Ryan for the brand name rather than faithfully trying to tell a story about him."
tt0164184,205. The Sum of All Fears,6.5,2002,128000.0,2h 4m,PG-13,"Jack Ryan&#39;s entry with lots of noisy action , thrills , chills , tension and amazing thriller . This blockbuster is an acceptable adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to other prior renditions . The title is paraphrased from a Winston Churchill speech; &quot;Why, you can take the most gallant sailor, the most intrepid airman or the most audacious soldier, put them at a table together - what do you get? The sum of their fears.&quot; It deals with CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) along with a ranking member (Morgan Freeman) of Presidential administration must thwart the plans of a terrorist faction that threatens to induce a catastrophic conflict between the United States and Russia&#39;s newly elected president by detonating a nuclear weapon at a football game in Baltimore. As there are 27,000 Nuclear Weapons and One Is Missing . Now Ryan goes back in action for the most vital assignment of his life : to save the President (James Cromwell) and the nation .Stirring outing filled with emotion , suspense , chills , twisted intrigue and extraordinary nail-biting action scenes . This film is a prequel to the others in the Jack Ryan series . The &#39;Harrison Ford&#39; films are direct follow-ups to The hunt for Red October (1990) despite the recast of Alec Baldwin&#39;s role . Nevertheless, in this film we see Jack Ryan meet John Clark, something which also happens in Clear and present danger (1994) . Therefore this film might be best understood as a reboot of the Jack Ryan series . Interesting screenplay plenty of twists and thrills by Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne . However , the filmmaker changed the villains from Islamic extremists , in the novel , to Neo-Nazis ; this was done because prior to the 11 September 2001 attacks, he did not believe Arab terrorists could plausibly accomplish all that was necessary for the plot to work on film . Good production design , in fact , the CIA scenes were filmed at the actual CIA headquarters ; this was one of the times the CIA had ever done such a thing . And this was the first American film unit to enter the Kremlin , though Red Heat (1988) was the first American unit to film in Moscow . The spectacular &quot;Super Bowl&quot; scene takes place in Baltimore , the two teams playing in the game are portrayed by the Toronto Argonauts and the Montreal Alouettes . Real U. S. Marines along with two Marine Corps CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters were used for the sequence of rescuing Fowler from the wrecked motorcade . The picture has a very good support cast who gives excellent performances such as James Cromwell as President Fowler , Bruce McGill as National Security Adviser , John Beasley as General Lasseter , Philip Baker Hall as Defense Secretary , Joseph Sommer as Senator , Michael Byrne , Liev Schreiber , Alan Bates , Sven-Ole Thorsen , Ron Rifkin , Colm Feore and special mention to Ciaran Hinds as Russia President . Spectacular musical score fitting to action and suspense by maestro veteran Jerry Goldsmith . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by John Lindley . The picture is well directed by Phil Alden Robinson , though Philip Noyce, director of previous entries, was offered to direct but turned it down and Wolfgang Petersen was also offered the chance to direct but declined.This blockbuster is an entertaining adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to ¨The hunt for Red October¨ by John MacTiernan with Alec Balwin and Sean Connery , followed by ¨Patriot games¨ (1992) by Philip Noyce with Harrison Ford taking over the role of Ryan from Alec Baldwin and again ¨Clear and present danger¨(1994) by Philip Noyce with Harrison Ford and Anne Archer . Then Harrison Ford dropped out of reprising the role of Jack Ryan because he and director Phillip Noyce could not agree on the script and Noyce ended up dropping out of the film as well. And finally , Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2014) by Kenneth Brannagh with Chris Pine as Jack Ryan , Keira Knightley and Kevin Costner ."
tt0158423,206. NetForce,5.0,1999,1400.0,3h 20m,R,"Made for tv movies can never escape the feeling they we&#39;re made for television. The taste, the sight and the scent. It&#39;s always there. Tom Clancy&#39;s Netforce itself was originally a two part television movie (how little did I know). In fact, it&#39;s all still somewhat a wash. Let me break it down for you.Flash forward to 2005. The internet has become so powerful and potentially dangerous that the US government sets up a division within the FBI entitled &quot;Netforce&quot; to preside over it from the evil people of the world who look to exploit it for their corrupt plans. Personally I seriously disbelieve the internet holds the future of the world in it&#39;s grasp, but that doesn&#39;t matter because the people at Netforce couldn&#39;t protect it if they had to anyway.Upon meeting the major characters we realize they&#39;re roles we&#39;ve all seen before. Like the male main character who&#39;s strong and dresses well. The rest of the cast fit typical molds. I especially liked how a certain character&#39;s ex-wife is a news reporter who at one point becomes a key piece in the story. Everyone is so linked together. Realistic? No. Then again none of the characters have any real depth. They&#39;re just names and faces. There&#39;s also too many needless minor characters who provide nothing but padding and viewer confusion. It gets hard remembering twenty characters throughout a two plus hour movie. I want to give credit for trying to develop them, but it fails because we know they&#39;re insignificant.Frankly I expected more from such an ensemble cast too. Scott Bakula gets to look smart in suit, but this could have benefited from someone with more clout than Bakula. He&#39;s sufficient, but that&#39;s about it. Meanwhile Kris Kristofferson gets the cliché elder role and good &#39;ol Brian Dennehy has been given the plum task of the President&#39;s Chief Of Staff. That means him popping up spewing &#39;How his ass is on the line&#39; or &#39;the President&#39;s p***ed at him&#39;. Yes good actors can&#39;t save bad scripts. That&#39;s a fact. Which bothers me even further because this product has Tom Clancy&#39;s name written all over it. Yet it isn&#39;t anywhere near the quality of his past outings. It&#39;s a real disservice. Some of the blame has to fall straight into the writer&#39;s lap too. I say this because I find it hard to see this as an adaptation project that started well. It was bad from the get-go. The story stinks. It&#39;s amateur hour.Especially considering how much they squeeze into their time frame. Would more have helped? I&#39;m hesitant to say. Even with over two hours they still came back with this slop. Frankly 160 minutes is a long time and there isn&#39;t enough depth to sustain a person&#39;s interest or the holding of disbelief for such a period.It can&#39;t even be taken seriously. Like Judge Reinhold playing the &#39;evil multi-billion dollar software tycoon&#39; looking to control the world or how corny it is to have FBI agents point loaded weapons in the faces of innocent cabdrivers. It&#39;s things like these that help make Netforce such a bore and honestly for a film dealing so heavily with computers and the internet, they sure went skimpy on the technical aspects too. I guess they didn&#39;t want to lose their biggest viewing demographic ... computer inept coach potatoes and patriotic Tom Clancy fans.For what it&#39;s trying to be, NetForce offers very little (if any) paranoia, suspense or &quot;edge of your seat excitement&quot; as so called critics would say. Netforce draws nothing but boredom and that&#39;s not exactly new territory. Last thing too. A golden rule of movies. If they don&#39;t find a body 95% of the time that&#39;s a clear signal the person ain&#39;t dead. That&#39;s the facts."
tt0114691,207. OP Center,5.7,1995,708.0,,,"Let me start off by saying that I saw the 114 minute long version of this film that was released on DVD. Everything in this review is based on that, as it is the only one I have seen. I have read two of Tom Clancy&#39;s OP Center books, so I knew most of the fictitious people before viewing this film, and I must say, it&#39;s quite fun to watch, having read so much about them... most even looked almost exactly like I imagined they would. The casting department did a great job on that... their work is quite impressive, with just about every single recurring character from the books being perfectly cast, as far as looks, type and personality goes. The plot is interesting, realistic and develops nicely throughout the entire film. The pacing is very good, it keeps you watching and stays quite intense more or less all the way through... blink once, and you might miss something crucial to the story. The acting is pretty much all top-notch, with almost no exceptions. They managed to get some fairly big names(well, for TV, anyway), too. The film has plenty of tension and suspense throughout, with a few scenes being packed to the limit with it. The action is great. Much better than in regular TV-movies. The special effects are also of unusually high quality. My only real problem with this film is that there&#39;s too little of it... it&#39;s clearly cut down from a larger product, and it feels like half a film as a result. I hope I&#39;ll get a chance to see a full mini-series one day. I would love to see the rest of this. I recommend this to any fan of Tom Clancy and any of his books. It&#39;s his style, through and through. Just make sure to see the full one... don&#39;t go for the shortened one I saw, if you can choose either. 7/10"
tt0109444,208. Clear and Present Danger,6.9,1994,112000.0,2h 21m,PG-13,"Tom Clancy&#39;s Jack Ryan has had an odd time at the movies. So far 3 actors and as many directors have had a go at him, with varying degrees of success. Hunt for Red October might come up in conversations more often, but it&#39;s hard to get past the silliness of Sean Connery pretending to be Russian (and speaking worse Russian than Baldwin&#39;s American character).Clear and Present Danger is where your money belongs. One of Clancy&#39;s best Ryan efforts in print, this massive door-stop of a book was condensed by veteran scribes Steven Zallian and John Milius - how&#39;s that for a screen writing combo? - into a script that retains a lot of the original&#39;s moral complexity while making smart concessions to the blockbuster format. For a blockbuster is what you have before you, and one of the smartest ones out there, where art and commerce were combined in perfect harmony.As Ryan 2.0, Harrison Ford is perfect in the lead, and it&#39;s hard to believe at times, that Clancy didn&#39;t have him in mind when creating the character. With a narrative this fragmented, it is essential that the supporting roles be pitch perfect and across the board everyone does first-rate work, with special mention to Willem Dafoe as John Clarke and Donald Moffat at a devious commander in chief.Philip Noyce builds on his Ryan-debut Patriot Games and shows he is equally at ease with the quiet parts and the loud ones, particularly an RPG-powered car ambush centerpiece. The action beats are used sparingly but with brilliant precision.All in all, this is smart, tight, believable and expertly executed. It is that rare brainy &quot;action&quot; film that will involve you and have you hanging on the edge of your seat."
tt0105112,209. Patriot Games,6.8,1992,125000.0,1h 57m,R,"If I were to make a quick summary of this movie, it would be &quot;a good, but not great, action flick.&quot;  I don&#39;t think this movie was intended to be innovative, to be great, to be memorable.  What it was intended to be was entertaining, and it lived up to this expectation.Harrison Ford is the master of remaining as low-key as possible.  He has had so many films where he can over-emphasize, over-dramatize, and simply over-act.  Ford has the maturity to keep this from happening, and he does so again in this film.  Ford is supported quite well with such actors/actresses as James Earl Jones (reprising his role as Greer from The Hunt for Red October), Samuel L. Jackson, and Anne Archer.  For an action flick, acting is much above average.It was also suspenseful...thrilling.  I thought the ending had a nice build-up and climax.  I realize this is different from the book&#39;s ending...but remember, these are two different visions...not the same one. This brings up a big point in movie-watching:  Comparing a movie to a book is the worst thing you can do.  They are two completely different genres. More importantly, as I said before, they are two different visions.I&#39;m not a big action fan.  I used to be, but anymore most stories are the same.  To this end I would say Patriot Games is fairly mainstream. However, it was always fun to watch and sometimes thrilling to watch.  I&#39;m also not a big Tom Clancy fan, but I&#39;ve given the movies based off his books a shot because again they are different visions.  The result is (at least with Patriot Games) a good film to watch on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn.  Don&#39;t expect great things, but don&#39;t expect to be disappointed, either.Rating:  7/10"
tt0099810,210. The Hunt for Red October,7.5,1990,223000.0,2h 15m,PG,"This film is written as great as a great book. Many of the dialogues have deeper meanings.
There&#39;s a lot of political stuff in this film, which is very well presented.
The music score is fantastic.
The editing is top notch.
The cast is perfect - Sean Connery, Sam Neill, Alec Baldwin, Tim Curry and many more fantastic actors.
The thriller aspect of this film is superb, it&#39;s a very gripping and supense movie.I loved this experience of a film."
tt0077610,211. The Ghost of Flight 401,5.7,1978,732.0,1h 40m,,"The true story of an Eastern Airlines L-1011 which crashed in the Everglades while making a long approach on Miami International Airport.  It is surmised the pilot while distracted because of nose gear warning, inadvertently disengaged the auto pilot resulting in the plane crashing.  Sightings of the dead crew were reported over the next several years by several dozen Eastern employees, who had known them. A true mystery of the supernatural. A film well worth watching."
tt0311113,212. Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7.5,2003,246000.0,2h 18m,PG-13,"There is a scene in MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD where the captain of a British Naval ship, circa 1805, debates the difference between duty and passion. Having passed on an opportunity to make wonderful new discoveries in favor of the pursuit of a massive French war ship, the scene manages to make a rather eloquent, yet subtle comment on the nature of man and his place within the world. The beauty of this film is that there are many such moments where the viewer is simultaneously bombarded with thematic musings, exciting action sequences, great acting and historical accuracy to the point where it becomes difficult to take it all in at once. Those of you looking for something more like Pirates of the Caribbean will be disappointed as this film is short on action and long on character development. There are only two major battle sequences, separated by more than an hour and a half of time. And while they are great; violently realistic and dramatically involving, the real guts of this film lies in the human stories told along the way. The director, Peter Weir, highlights his ability to tell an intimate story amidst a grand backdrop much like he did in The Truman Show. We get to know these men, their strengths and weaknesses and we see how the long and hard voyage plays on their minds over the film&#39;s progression. In one scene, a young officer feels the pressure of his men&#39;s dismissive stares and decides to end matters in his own way, afraid of what may be in store for him should he stick it out. Weir does a good job at highlighting the many facets of seafaring life. If you&#39;re looking for an intelligent and thought-provoking journey into the life of a 19th Century British Naval Vessell, look no further. Master and Commander has the depth of a good Discovery Channel show and the action worthy of almost any other high-seas adventure that comes to mind."
tt0465537,213. Mayday,5.0,2005,699.0,1h 27m,TV-PG,"This film may have been less far-fetched than the Nelson DeMille/Thomas Block novel on which it is based, but it lacks the tension which the authors provided so well. Director T.J. Scott is obviously constrained by the network-television format, which allows little blood and no coarse language -- still, he should have let the main characters look increasingly unkempt and sweaty after the accident. Other mistakes include a subplot involving several characters who weren&#39;t in the book, and some weakly interpreted villains (Johnson suffers the most; where is his swagger and sardonic humor). This rates a 5 because the cast members do their best, the effects are good for a TV-movie, and there are a few nice touches (at one point the film refers to a change of terminology between the 1978 and 1997 versions of the novel). It&#39;s sad, though, that &quot;Mayday&quot; never got a big-budget blockbuster treatment.-Tony"
tt0369059,214. Word of Honor,6.4,2003,612.0,1h 31m,,A very good TNT original movie made for TV. A former Army Lieutenant(Don Johnson) sees his world falling apart when allegations that his platoon slaughtered innocent civilians thirty years ago in a hospital massacre. Jeanne Tripplehorn plays the Army Major prosecutor. The defending attorney is played flawlessly by Arlin Howard. Also in the cast is Sharon Lawrence as the Lieutenant&#39;s lovely wife; John Heard as the platoon member &quot;blowing the whistle&quot; and Johnson&#39;s son Jesse plays the young Lieutenant in Vietnam. Good courtroom drama. Well worth watching. It&#39;s also nice seeing Johnson letting go of some of the ego. He is aging nicely and still can command a scene.
tt1189340,215. The Lincoln Lawyer,7.3,2011,262000.0,1h 58m,R,"WOW ! Reading the reviews on this movie were more about Matthew M. being cast and his supposedly poor films. People do you not recall &quot;A Time To Kill&quot; he was very great, &quot;Frailty&quot; very good, very scary. &quot;Thirteen Conversations About One Thing&quot; Amazing. &quot;Ed TV&#39; great and sweet.and more where his shirt stays on. Cut it out!!!The movie is good, it stuck to the book and did not get bent of Michael C&#39;s concept. I truly dislike when a book is made into a movie and manipulated.As for Matthews performance, he seems a little more laid back then as in the movies mentioned above, but I do enjoy seeing him play the clever lawyer type."
tt0309377,216. Blood Work,6.4,2002,49000.0,1h 50m,R,"&#39;Blood Work&#39; sees actor/director Clint Eastwood ease into a more traditional, mature and work-heavy detective story based upon Michael Connelly&#39;s novel. We follow that of FBI profiler Terry McCaleb on the trail of a serial killer who likes to play games with him, before his heart eventually gives up on him during a chase. He&#39;s a cardiac patient that receives a heart from a murder victim, and the donor&#39;s sister asks him to come out of retirement (which is two years after the heart-attack) to use that second chance to help find her killer.After an excellently dark, brooding opening it goes onto settle for a cruising old-fashion, but by-the-numbers thriller. It&#39;s the eerie mystery that invokes the tension, not the small-added slabs of violence and action. It&#39;s a character story. Nothing surprises, but its elaborated make-up and cluey puzzles are absorbingly plotted by Brian Helgeland&#39;s elegantly dry screenplay, as we watch the psychical and mental decay first break down, but eventually go on to help rebuild our main protagonist. Mainly through his bond with the lady he&#39;s helping out. Even a connection is kind of hinted between the killer and Eastwood&#39;s ex-profiler like the one in &#39;Tightrope&#39; (1984). The relationship that unfolds and expectations that arose, especially after the killer&#39;s unmasking and his cunning intentions being revealed is unnerving in that endearing sense. The psychological torment and involvement is well-judged too. This observation can be seen in Eastwood&#39;s rock-like performance, which still shows cracks of vulnerability.Looking comfortable in front of the camera, behind is exactly the same with his economical direction driving the way. Edgy suspense is well-place and timed amongst a gritty backdrop and dreary colour scheme. Lennie Niehaus&#39; soothingly savoury blues score, Tom Stern&#39;s sharply pastel cinematography and Joel Cox&#39;s swift editing strengthen the already professionally competent production. First-rate performances engulf the feature. Wanda De Jesus strong-willed turn is amiable. Jeff Daniel&#39;s lazy; oddball (almost comic) performance is a fine, versatile addition. A cynical Paul Rodriguez and a solid Dylan Walsh are good as two jealous detectives. Tina Lafford is pleasingly sound as a detective/good friend of McCaleb and Anjelica Huston is fiery blunt as Dr. Bonnie Fox.A satisfyingly better than average thriller fable headed by the ever-reliable Eastwood."

Margo has been living across the street for 11 years. They were friends when she first arrived. They found a dead body but he refused to follow her adventures and they drifted apart. Now suddenly, she climbs into his window. She pulls him into a night of revenge against her cheating boyfriend and her backstabbing friends. She&#39;s gone the next day but she has left clues for Quentin to find her paper town. Quentin, Ben, Radar, Radar&#39;s girlfriend Angela, and Margo&#39;s friend Lacey go on a road trip.Cara Delevingne shows competent acting and a good intriguing presence which is necessary for the role. The movie starts with her taking our lead on a nice adventure. It has its moments. I like those one-night adventures in movies. Then there is the mystery which is less compelling because I&#39;m mostly waiting for the inevitable road trip. I also like a good road trip and this one has its moments, too. The movie ends with a nice &#39;lesson&#39;. Everything is fair but nothing is outstanding. The three guys are nice but lacks great charisma. They are more and less regular teens which has its appeal. I like their friendship. As a book, I&#39;m sure this has many fans. As a movie, it needs more adventures and more cinematic excitement. It could have tightened the middle and added more to the road trip when the group is together. This is fine but it could have been much better."

I am a sucker for a good love story, especially love that I can relate to. The pain and emotions felt by the characters felt so real, as if I was feeling the same emotions.Though this was THE SADDEST movie I have ever seen, it was also one of the most beautiful, as it truly showed how exhilarating and comforting and exciting love is. I probably cried throughout about half of the movie, along with the rest of the audience. I cried to the point of heaving out loud and needing more than the 2 tissues I came in with. Again, the actors really expressed the emotions of the characters well and I felt that. I am going to see it again for sure.GO SEE IT IF YOU LOVE EMOTIONAL MOVIES!"

I feel like she was just playing herself cause she has a personality like that in real life. It was pure joy to watch her play Lou. The expressions she makes, the way she talks and most of all, her amazing clothes! I loved every single outfit she wore. This film made me laugh and it made me very emotional, just like the book. I think Sam Claflin was also born to play Will. They had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film and the rest of the cast is also spot on. There are of course some parts from the book that were left out but nonetheless, this film was still amazing. I also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie is amazing as well."

Just bad writing.And the flow of the plot is painfully cliché, up until the end where things are admittedly pretty unpredictable. The ending was unexpected, but it worked and made up for earlier plot points that were predictable.&quot;21&quot; is entertaining, that&#39;s it. Nothing more, nothing less."
tt0099731,222. The Handmaid's Tale,6.0,1990,12000.0,1h 48m,R,"This is a nightmare vision of the future. It seems 1 out of every 100 women is fertile (for some reason). The ones who aren&#39;t perform slave labor. The ones that are are &quot;sold&quot; off to rich families where they have sex with the husband to produce a baby. Kate (the late and missed Natasha Richardson) is one such servant to Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway) and her husband the Commander (Robert Duvall). Kate wants out--but it seems there&#39;s no way.The synopsis only scratches the surface of a VERY dark and disturbing movie. It slowly shows how women are treated and used and it just gets more horrifying as it unfolds. The parallels to Hitler&#39;s Nazi Germany are fairly obvious but here we have barren women instead of Jews and gays. The good acting by everybody makes this hard to shake off. Aidan Quinn (as Nick) and Duvall are OK; Victoria Tennant is chilling as a leader of the camps; Elizabeth McGovern is just great as a fellow prisoner who befriends Kate; Dunaway is also very good in her role. Best of all is Richardson. This couldn&#39;t have been an easy role but she pulls it off beautifully. She died at far too young an age. This is basically an unknown movie and it&#39;s easy to see why--it&#39;s far too dark and disturbing for a general audience. However the ending is (sort of) uplifting (and changed from the book). Grim, dark and depressing. View it at your own risk. The ceremony sequences are almost impossible to watch and shocked the hell out of me the first time I saw this."
tt2322441,223. Fifty Shades of Grey,4.2,2015,346000.0,2h 5m,R,"I never had any intention of watching &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;...none. However, when IMDB recently revamped their Bottom 100 List and I saw the movie was now on the list, I felt I had to see it. After all, I constantly am checking out the list to see what new additions there are so I can watch them. I do occasionally like seeing a bad movie...they can be very entertaining and unintentionally funny. Now &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; is very different from any other film on the list (with the exception of &quot;The Last Airbender&quot;) in that it WAS a mega-hit and lots of people liked it...though at the same time its score of 4.1 on IMDB is anemic....making it a love-hate sort of picture.Anastasia Steele (great name, huh?) is a dim sort of lady....and I&#39;m sorry but there&#39;s no better way to describe her accurately. When she goes to interview a big-shot businessman, Christian Grey, she has no idea what she&#39;s doing, hasn&#39;t prepared in the least and asks him only banal questions. She seemed rather dull and with little personality and it was difficult to see what he saw in her. Yet, despite this, inexplicably Grey is now obsessed with her. In some ways, he seems like a nice guy--such as coming to her aid when she&#39;s drunk in a dance club soon after this meeting. But in many, he gives so many signs that he&#39;s not normal in the least...and rather creepy and possibly very dangerous. He&#39;s incredibly controlling and in response to her getting drunk he says &quot;If you were mine, you wouldn&#39;t be able to sit down for a week&quot;. In other words, for getting drunk and behaving stupidly, he&#39;d paddle the crap out of her! He then has her sign a non-disclosure agreement--saying she&#39;ll never tell anyone about him!! Soon, they are embarking on a weird S&amp;M relationship...and that&#39;s when the film shows a lot of nekkidness, though it&#39;s of the soft-core variety. But he is clear...this is NOT love and he doesn&#39;t want to be close to anyone...and he doesn&#39;t even want to actually sleep with her...just have his way with her.What I find so bizarre about the whole &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; phenomenon is that in the 21st century, the actions of BOTH Anastasia and Christian are the exact opposite of what society is telling us folks should be like or what romance should be. There really ISN&#39;T any romance...and he doesn&#39;t want to date her. It&#39;s not so much just the S&amp;M aspects that I found bothersome...it&#39;s more that you have a man who dominates a woman and controls her and she is passive and does whatever he says. Her needs are also not particularly important and he wants to control every aspect of her life and breaks into her apartment when she isn&#39;t home. This is NOT the feminist idea of today...at least not what folks SAY they want in a relationship. I simply do not understand this dichotomy...nor why folks loved the books and films...yet also claim to hate them! I also worry that a film like this could set the stage for date rapes, as here in the film it&#39;s supposed to be romantic...but in real life, it could get you imprisoned. Weird.So although I found the message strange and possibly dangerous and the writing occasionally silly, what about the techincal aspects of the movie? The movie is very polished--with lovely and very appropriate music, excellent cinematography and is very artistic. For this reason alone, although I didn&#39;t like or respect the message, the film deserves more than a few stars on IMDB. I should add that although the film features a lot of nudity, I really didn&#39;t find it all that exciting to watch...mostly because the film was just creepy. It also didn&#39;t come off as sexy....just creepy. And, it probably would NOT be a great date night film...as your date might think you are...just creepy. Watch it if you&#39;d like...I just didn&#39;t particular enjoy it nor understand WHY it made so much money...I just found it, believe it or not, to be rather dull."
tt4465564,224. Fifty Shades Darker,4.6,2017,117000.0,1h 58m,R,"Neither as good or as bad as so many commentators seem to think. It has high production values. The direction is unobtrusive. I haven&#39;t read the novels, so cannot really comment on the source material. Dakota Johnson hit the corruptible ingenue character pretty well, and looks smashing while doing so. Jamie Dornan, though... In my comments on the first movie, I compared his depth of emotion to a terminator. In this one, he at least attempts some emotional scenes. He doesn&#39;t do them very well, but he tries. Supporting cast, especially Marcia Gay Harden, were pretty good, with the exception of Kim Basinger. There is really no reason to see this, except as a continuation of the first movie. It could never stand alone."
tt4477536,225. Fifty Shades Freed,4.5,2018,79000.0,1h 45m,R,"The first of the three that is actually emotionally intense. The film felt short compared to the book, but that&#39;s normal. Also, while watching, I found myself making cinematic connections between this and the last 2 Twilight movies, which was funny, especially given E.L. James&#39;s start as a fan fiction author. Is it an Oscar-worthy performance? No. Is it entertaining for a week night after a long day at work? Yes."
tt1840309,226. Divergent,6.6,2014,505000.0,2h 19m,PG-13,"Just finished reading the book &quot;Divergent&quot; before the movie opened today. It was a quick easy read. There was obvious inspiration from various other futuristic young adult books I have read, like &quot;The Giver&quot;, &quot;Ender&#39;s Game&quot; and the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; books. Like the others, the treatment of the story was cold, But its descriptions of the initiation rites were very much more violent. The setting is the walled city of Chicago after a great war. Their society is divided into five distinct Factions based on personality traits: Dauntless (brave), Amity (friendly), Candor (honest), Erudite (intelligent) and Abnegation (selfless). At the age of 16, a child takes an examination to help him choose which one will be his faction for the rest of his life. He may follow the suggestion of the exam results, or he may decide on his own. Those who fail to be accepted into a faction becomes factionless, as they become hopelessly poor and destitute for life. Our heroine Beatrice Prior has been born to the Abnegation faction with their grey clothes and disdain for any form of vanity. However, her examination results are revealed to be inconclusive, so she has to make her own decision. Meanwhile, an uprising is brewing in Erudite against the government run by Abnegation. I had some problem with the book and the way they try to make the Factions distinct from each other, when it is easy to see that overlapping does happen. These traits simply cannot be mutually exclusive from each other. It is also disturbing the way the author describes the Dauntless. Does being brave mean jumping off running trains, having piercings and tattoos, beating each other up mercilessly, or even killing yourself? This may give immature readers the wrong ideas about courage. o - o - o -The film was a perfectly conceived interpretation of the book. In the first few scenes where they show the color-coded clothes distinguishing each faction was quite clear. How director Neil Burger showed us most of the memorable scenes in the book, like the choosing ceremony, the jumping on and off the trains, the fear landscapes of Tris and Four, and the invasion of Abnegation were all very well done.There were some parts which were reinterpreted in the film. Most did not really affect the story-telling, like changing how Tris meets her Mom during Visiting Day, or glossing over a particularly violent episode where Peter stabs a fellow initiate in the eye. There was one big change towards the end about how a climactic surprise rescue transpired. I thought the version in the book was so much more better set-up and executed than the less-dramatic altered version we saw on screen.As I suspected, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely not the small and mousy Tris we imagine while reading the book. However, I thought Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of Tris&#39; character, how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior. For people who have not read the books, they will not be aware of any discrepancy at all. Theo James had very good romantic chemistry with Shailene, so his Four never really felt like a threat to Tris, unlike the initial parts in the book. The director gave James a lot of lingering close-ups for the benefit of the teenage fan girls. Ansel Elgort, who played Tommy Ross in &quot;Carrie&quot; recently, now plays Tris&#39; brother Caleb. His Caleb is less dynamic than I imagined him in the book. Coincidentally, Elgort has an upcoming movie with Shailene Woodley later this year called &quot;The Fault in Our Stars&quot; where they play boyfriend-girlfriend.More up and coming actors play other more minor characters. Zoe Kravitz, who was in &quot;After Earth&quot; last year, is not exactly how I envisioned Tris&#39; best friend, but she won me over as the film went along. Miles Teller, who was recently in &quot;That Awkward Moment&quot;, plays bad boy Peter, whose role in the film is much diminished compared to the book. Jai Courtney, who played Bruce Willis&#39; son in &quot;A Good Day to Die Hard&quot; last year, brutally plays Tris&#39; tormentor in the training camp. Among the senior stars, Ashley Judd makes a nice comeback of sorts playing Tris&#39; mother, who had major secrets of her own. Maggie Q played Tris&#39; examiner and tattoo artist Tori with the requisite compassion. Kate Winslet plays the cool and calculating Erudite uprising leader Jeanine with icy perfection.Overall, I thought this film was a practically perfect interpretation of a book that was less than perfect in itself. So, whatever things the film might show us which we might not like, like the slow pace of action progression, and the questionable motives of the characters, are actually because the book told it that way. Fans of the &quot;Divergent&quot; books will find this film version faithful. While it cannot compare to the high standard set by the Hunger Games film series in terms of cinematic quality and character casting, &quot;Divergent&quot; definitely has its own entertaining appeal going for it. 7/10."
tt3410834,227. Allegiant,5.7,2016,141000.0,,PG-13,"Allegiant was rather disappointing considering i really enjoyed the first 2 movies. This one was very lackluster on the action and Tris character was much less involved in the plot. I hate the fact that this movie ended on a cliffhanger though. Because it has been 4 years ago and due to the bad box office this film got, there has been no real try to make a fourth and final film."
tt2908446,228. Insurgent,6.2,2015,264000.0,1h 59m,PG-13,"My brother and I are fans of the books and we generally enjoyed the first film. However, this film doesn&#39;t amount to either. Sure, the visuals aren&#39;t bad, I especially like the look of the film and the action wasn&#39;t bad. The big problem with this is mostly just the storyline. It just seems quite bland.That&#39;s really all I can say. This film is just bland."
tt0037913,229. Mildred Pierce,7.9,1945,30000.0,1h 51m,Approved,"With those broad shoulders, those wall-to-wall eyebrows, that steely look on her face, and wrapped in those expensive clothes, the inimitable Joan Crawford exudes glamour and resolve as famed Mildred Pierce, housewife turned businesswoman, in this Michael Curtiz-directed film, part mystery, part melodrama.The film&#39;s story, told in flashbacks, begins with mystery, and it is helped along by terrific B&amp;W lighting. Most of the rest of the story is sheer melodrama, with talky dialogue that erupts from confrontations between various characters. The most important confrontations occur between Mildred and her ungrateful, scheming daughter Veda, who requires tons of money to be happy. As the story moves along, Mildred buys and successfully operates a restaurant, but it&#39;s not enough to win approval from her odious daughter. Mildred&#39;s love for Veda is deep. But Mildred, we learn, is also a take-charge woman who won&#39;t take any guff from anyone, at least from caddy suitors or prospective in-laws.It&#39;s a great story. And in addition to the topnotch cinematography, the film has great production design, costumes, and editing. We&#39;re also treated to some pleasantly nostalgic music from the 1940s. Crawford gets good support performances from Ann Blyth, Eve Arden, and Jack Carson. I also liked Butterfly McQueen, the little lady with the high-pitched voice who plays Mildred&#39;s maid.I suspect this film would have been worthy of praise, even with someone else playing the title character; the film is that good. But no other actress would have had the stage presence of the impressive Joan Crawford. It&#39;s mostly because of her that &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; will be remembered and loved, for generations to come. It&#39;s also partly because of &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; that Joan Crawford will be admired as a Hollywood legend, for generations to come."

tt0041959,231. The Third Man,8.1,1949,189000.0,1h 44m,Approved,"Although I am as old as this movie, produced in 1949, I have not aged nearly as well. This film, directed brilliantly by Carol Reed (&quot;Odd Man Out&quot;, &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot;) and written by Graham Greene, who created a long list of memorable cinematic scripts, ingeniously captures the prevailing atmosphere of disruption and chaos that Vienna, a once highly civilized city, experienced during the years that followed World War II. The upheaval is physical, social, economic, political, moral, spiritual. You name it. Vanquished Vienna, conquered by the Allies, was crippled by turmoil in every imaginable way, and we viewers are given the opportunity to experience it up close, right here.I spent a number of months in Europe after I graduated from college in 1971. Although the war had been over for more than 25 years by then, I was struck by a very pronounced attitude of cynicism on the part of many Europeans regarding uniquely American ideals and principles, which were widely considered to be naive. To me, this film accurately captures this cultural and moral conflict, which lasted for decades and may even survive to this day. &quot;You and your American principles,&quot; they would often scoff at me with mocking derision. In many ways, the character of Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), an American who crashes into post-World War II Europe, is a victim of a serious cultural divide. Unlike the Europeans, Martins always has the option of fleeing from the chaos and returning to the United States. For that alone, he may be resented by the local Viennese.What does Anna (Alida Valli) know about the illegal activities of her lover, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), which includes the sale of diluted penicillin to Vienna&#39;s hospitals? For children with meningitis, watered down penicillin was not only useless, but it created an immunity from full strength penicillin so that these afflicted children could never receive effective treatment. Corrupted penicillin is a glaring symbol of a totally corrupted Vienna. Harry surely understands the consequences of his business, but what about Anna? Even after the truth about Harry&#39;s conduct is clearly revealed to her, she still sticks by him to the bitter end. Love conquers all? Stand by your man, regardless of the misery that he is causing to his innocent victims? While I don&#39;t blame her for rejecting the romantic overtures of Martins, who is somewhat of a schnook, what&#39;s with her anyway? She reminds me of the Europeans who never once caught a whiff of the burning flesh from the overworked crematoria of the concentration camps that blackened the air all around them. She is deeply in love with Harry, so just shut up about children with meningitis. OK, Anna, whatever you say, sweetheart. Perhaps those silly 18th century costume comedies in which you appear will provide the escape from reality that you so desperately seek. At least you manage to crack a weak, forced smile on stage, which is the only smile that we will ever see from you.From beginning to end, the unusual camera angles, the dark, somber, haunting sidewalks of Vienna, and the conquered city&#39;s eerie, drenched cobblestone streets contribute to the overall foreboding atmosphere of the film, which was remarkably photographed by Australian Robert Krasker (&quot;Odd Man Out&quot;, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;). From every direction and without advance notice, unforgettable images and characters appear before us, emphasizing an overall mood of mayhem and unpredictability. We witness, for example, Anna&#39;s landlady, draped in a bedspread for warmth in a state of deep distress by the sudden invasion of her house by &quot;officials&quot; representing not one foreign nation but four of them. Then we observe a ludicrous, bureaucratic &quot;cultural re-education conference&quot; offered to the Viennese by the allied victors, presumably to rehabilitate them after seven years of Nazi domination. And from where on earth did the balloon seller come as he pathetically peddles his merry merchandise on the dark, abandoned streets of Vienna, which are not only completely void of children at the time but of all people?And what of the inquisitive, confused character of Holly Martins, played with the usual, smooth agility of Joseph Cotten? As the writer of mass marketed western novels that even a young British sergeant happens to read, why is he broke, and what kind of job would Lime have offered him in an unfamiliar, German-speaking Vienna that is gripped by post-war disorder, unemployment, and foreign occupation? Construction work, perhaps?While some reviewers disliked the zither music of Anton Karas, I think that the unique, high pitched sound contributes to the general atmosphere of nervous tension and uneasiness that prevails. Would you prefer Strauss waltzes instead? They wouldn&#39;t be nearly as effective in conveying the overwhelming atmosphere of chaos, even insanity, that plagues Vienna on so many levels at the time.Finally, we are brought to the hidden network of grand Vienna&#39;s underground sewers. What could be a more fitting symbol of the underlying foulness that lurks beneath the thin, shallow surface of what we call &quot;civilization&quot;? This subterranean labyrinth provides the perfect setting for the ending of an extraordinary film that very effectively portrays a world that has succumbed to a state of disorder, misery, and even madness. Ultimately, it is all destined for the sewer. Bal-loon?"

The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,8.2,1948,137000.0,2h 6m,Approved,"Having had his day as an idolized star and romantic leading man, it was now time for Bogart to get down to the serious business of acting For eighteen years it had usually been Bogart playing Bogart in various shadings Now that Bogart was gone and in his place was an older and far less romantic figure, one who found new challenges and was able to meet most of them successfully This new phase of his continued growth began with a story of three men in search of gold Although &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; is indisputably one of Bogart&#39;s best films, it was co-star Walter Huston who won an Academy Award as did the movie&#39;s director and scenarist, John Huston Based on a novel by the mysterious B. Traven, the film told a riveting tale which explored the degenerative effects of encroaching greed, distrust, and hatred on three prospectors who team up to search for gold in Mexico Bogart&#39;s Fred C. Dobbs was an amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliant1y managed on camera He is a born loser with no potential for change in sight Suspicious, unfeeling, savage, and easily corruptible, he seems clearly destined for a tragic fate almost from our first meeting with him Tim Holt was also excellent as Bob Curtin, a man who, like Bogart, is tempted but whose conscience will not permit him to exercise his baser desires. (He could have let Bogart die in a cave-in, but saved him instead.) Young, impressionable, and unprepared, he has never seen the likes of a Fred C. Dobbs and he finds himself overwhelmed and uncertain as to how he will cope with Dobbs&#39;s rage and greed However, it is the director&#39;s father, Walter Huston, who literally stole the picture from both Bogart and Holt as he played Howard, a wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen and took it all in stride, kicking up his heels and having a marvelous time Life can&#39;t surprise him any more He&#39;s already had successes and failures enough for one lifetime Like a faithful dog, he&#39;s along for the thrill of the hunt, and should there be another pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, well, that&#39;s just a bonus It is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; one of Warner Brothers&#39; triumphs of the forties"

It is the first film in the Bond series where Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to Dr. No, a former member of a Chinese crime syndicate but currently working for SPECTRE.
Here Bond faces dragon-disguised swamp buggy, venomous tarantula spider, &#39;three blind mice&#39; n a villain with metal hands.
Fortunately Bond has three amazing ladies to cool off, Eunice Gayson, Zena Marshall n Ursula Andress.Some interesting facts from the novel which is missing in the movie.
The Chinese gangsters tortured Dr No, cut off his hands n shot him through the left side of the chest and left him for dead.
Dr No survived due to a condition called dextrocardia in which his heart is on the right side of the body. He later joined SPECTRE n got his metal hands."

The team on an American research base get surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That&#39;s the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I&#39;ve ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don&#39;t know &#39;cause as far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who&#39;s just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven&#39;t seen it all until you&#39;ve seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.The movie didn&#39;t get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it&#39;s not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I&#39;ve asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I&#39;ve seen it several times, but it&#39;s just as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian the only thing I don&#39;t like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!"

tt0057115,237. The Great Escape,8.2,1963,268000.0,2h 52m,Approved,"During World War Two the Germans build a new prison camp, Stalag Luft III, for the express purpose of housing many of their most troublesome captured Allied airmen. However, all this serves to do is to pool the resources of some of the most ingenious escape artists in captivity and fill them with a resolve to engineer a mass breakout from the camp.   Based largely on real events, this film has assumed classic status over the years and its easy to understand why. Quite simply, it excells in many departments. Director John Sturges was at the height of his creative powers and he keeps a firm grip on the proceedings. Although the film runs close to three hours it never feels sluggish, while at the same time winding up the tension gradually and developing the characters. The production design is first rate, to the point where Donald Pleasance (who had been a P.O.W.) felt quite intimidated by the vast set on his arrival. Daniel Fapp&#39;s beautiful photography shows this and the picturesque German locations off to full effect. Put these virtues together with a good script, inspired casting and a classic score by Elmer Bernstein, and you have an object lesson in how to create an intelligent and exciting big budget adventure film.   On the subject of the cast; Much is made of Steve McQueen&#39;s role. While I am a huge McQueen fan, I feel that some of the other performances are equal to, if not better than his. Richard Attenborough, James Garner, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson and Gordon Jackson are all excellent. Good too are James Coburn, James Donald, David McCallum and Hannes Messemer as the sympathetic Commandant.   This is one of those films that I can happily watch time and time again. In September of this year a new print was screened at the NFT in London as part of an &#39;Attenborough at 80&#39; season. It was a pleasure to see this on the big screen at last. For the most part the print was in very good condition. The DVD was one of the first that I ever bought some three and a half years ago, and I watched its inevitable Christmas screening on BBC2 last night. I just never tire of it. In these days of brainless, poorly executed action fodder, its a joy to behold something that hits its targets so precisely."
tt0073486,238. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,8.7,1975,1100000.0,2h 13m,R,"I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the &#39;top five&#39; Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as &quot;one of Jack Nicholson&#39;s finest roles&quot; and &quot;one of the classics of the 70&#39;s&quot;. Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy&#39;s intention, as he believes the conditions in a &quot;crazy house&quot; will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it&#39;s desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in &#39;Chinatown&#39; or &#39;As Good as it Gets&#39;. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can&#39;t help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest which hasn&#39;t already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it&#39;s glorious entirety. It&#39;s hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-10/10"

Paper Moon,8.1,1973,55000.0,1h 42m,PG,"Unlike many films of the early 1970s, plenty before and after, viewing this doesn&#39;t continually remind you of the time of its creation, but instead deposits you into the age of the Great Depression where your mind resides for the duration.The development of the relationship between Moses and Addie is near perfect, their capers, scrapes and mischief endearingly conjuring a bond they both desperately need. I didn&#39;t expect this to be anything like as engrossing, charming and engaging as it was, perhaps being the father of two daughters with attitude enhanced the experience, but whatever it was left a lasting impression."
tt0119488,240. L.A. Confidential,8.2,1997,640000.0,2h 18m,R,"What happens when a squad of corrupt cops in the 1950s explore a murder case from multiple angles and find their corruption coming back on them like chickens coming home to roost? Who will solve the crime? Who will survive and what will be left of them? This movie is phenomenal. The only reason I didn&#39;t give it 10 out of 10 is because I didn&#39;t care for the ending (which I won&#39;t reveal). It&#39;s a world were Hollywood and law enforcement cross over and even the hookers want to be movie stars. I have not read the Ellroy novels, but I have been told they are even more intricate than this film with a lot more backstory. I would watch a five or six hour version of this film. But even so, that is the strong point of this film: multiple stories that begin to overlap. Sure, others (Tarantino) have tried this, but I think this is the most expertly done conception I&#39;ve seen yet.Kevin Spacey&#39;s part as a Hollywood obsessed cop is beautiful and he fits the part to a tee. His role is supposed to be similar to Dean Martin and I can see that; Spacey again harnessed this kind of character when he made &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;. Spacey&#39;s role is the connection between the world of law and the world of fame.Russell Crowe plays the &quot;bad cop&quot; who crosses the line with sheer thuggery and an attraction to a prostitute (Kim Basinger, who does a fine job being both alluring yet tasteful). His part was supposed to be for Michael Madsen (one of the greatest actors of all time for a cop/crook movie), but I think Crowe may have been the better choice. Who else can be a natural thug?Guy Pearce... I was not sure how to take him. I have not enjoyed him (&quot;Time Machine&quot;) and yet also loved him (&quot;Memento&quot;). In the beginning, I thought it would be another geeky Pearce role and I was a bit concerned. But as the film progresses, so does Pearce&#39;s character become more lovable and impressive. You&#39;ll agree.Danny DeVito was okay and James Cromwell was insidiously delightful.Brian Helgeland adapted this screenplay. You may know him best as the writer of &quot;A Knight&#39;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Order&quot;. The Order was crappy. But A Knight&#39;s Tale is fantastic. This, by far, will go down as his crowning achievement. He may as well call up Michael Bay and go retire in the South Seas where they&#39;ll never be found.Simply put, this is the best film I&#39;ve seen in at least a month (and I watch at least a movie a day). Maybe the best film I&#39;ve seen all year. Don&#39;t set this movie aside, you need to put this on the top of your honeydew list."
tt1659337,241. The Perks of Being a Wallflower,7.9,2012,570000.0,1h 43m,PG-13,"Greetings again from the darkness. Brace for gushing. Last evening I attended a screening that included a fascinating Q&amp;A with writer/director Stephen Chbosky. It reminded me of how personal and intimate and observant and incisive a well-made film can be. A well written script is so refreshing, and an exceptional script can be truly breath-taking. Mr. Chbosky takes the unusual step of directing his own screenplay based on his own novel (a 1999 bestseller), and he left me stunned and enthralled.The popularity of the novel would typically make the film version a disappointment for its fans. Not so this time. Mr. Chbosky remains true to the spirit despite the need to edit for the sake of continuity and brevity. The key characters spring to life thanks to the efforts of four strong performances from young actors: Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson, The Three Muskateers) plays Charlie, Emma Watson (Harry Potter films) is Sam, Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin, City Island) is Patrick, and Mae Whitman (Arrested Development) is Mary Elizabeth.If you have read the book, you know the story ... you know the characters ... you know the themes. If you haven&#39;t read the book, I will spoil nothing. The brilliance is recognized only as you get to know these characters and slowly uncover their stories. What we discover is that, regardless of our age, we recognize these characters from our high school days. We know the introverted, observant Charlie who so desperately needs a support system. We surely recognize the attention-starved, lacking in self-esteem Sam who is the epitome of &quot;We accept the love we think we deserve&quot;. And we all knew a Patrick ... the flamboyant one who sheaths his pain with an over-the-top act of public confidence. What Chbosky does is shine the spotlight on these characters to ensure that we really SEE them this time.The themes reminded me a bit of a darker John Hughes film (that&#39;s a compliment). There were also pieces of two other really good films: Stand By Me and Almost Famous. The formative years of a writer determine the depths to which his or her work will reach later in life. Admittedly, the film is substantially autobiographical, so when Mr. Chbosky says it&#39;s a personal story, we begin to understand the foundation of his remarkable writing style.&quot;Welcome to the island of misfit toys.&quot; When this line is spoken, we realize that most every high school kid has thought the same thing at some point. These are painful and difficult times and as Mr. Chbosky stated, we should encourage kids to fight through this stage and get on to the next ... then able to find their true self. Clearly, the film made a strong impact on me. My favorite reaction to a movie is profound thought, and this one caused this in waves. The decision to release as PG-13 was wise. There is no excess of profanity or nudity to divert attention from what really matters ... the characters. I can think of no finer compliment to a writer and filmmaker than to cite them as the cause of my internal discussions related to their film. My hope is that you have the same reaction.

tt0063442,242. Planet of the Apes,8.0,1968,205000.0,1h 52m,G,"The original &#39;Planet of the Apes&#39; is better than the 2001 remake on almost every level. May be Tim Burton&#39;s version looks better, no wonder with Burton as the director, but the direction itself, the cinematography, the story and the performances in Franklin J. Schaffner&#39;s original are much better and more interesting.Heston is Taylor, who crashes with his spaceship on what seems to be a deserted planet. He and two other survivors start searching for life. They run into other human beings, and at that time they are all attacked by apes. The apes speak English, the human beings are mute. In this society a human being is what apes are in our society. Animals, nothing more. The humans are taken for research, Taylor as well, and since he is shot in the neck he is not able to talk at first. One of his fellow survivors is dead, what happened to the other is unsure. A female ape who is a scientist discovers that Taylor understands her, and even thinks he can talk. Of course this is not what the high people in this society want to hear.The movie has some very interesting elements. Worlds are upside down, as Taylor says, and in a way the movie puts a mirror in front of us. The human beings are humiliated in exactly the way we treat animals. What would we do if another mammal suddenly knew how to speak our language? We would probably react the same as the apes do in this movie and therefore it is even more interesting.In liked the movie very much, and some very nice moments in particular. Early in the movie Taylor gets a woman in his cage. He calls her Nova (Linda Harrison). We know what the apes want, and it is funny because it is exactly how we do this kind of stuff to our animals. The apes are even surprised when Taylor wants to keep his woman, and therefore seems monogamous.With some nice touches, a great and famous ending, some quotes that will sound very familiar, Charlton Heston as a pretty good leading man, a score from Jerry Goldsmith that is perfect for a movie like this, nice direction and a fine cinematography by Leon Shamroy this movie is a very good classic."
tt0056592,243. To Kill a Mockingbird,8.3,1962,343000.0,2h 9m,Approved,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children&#39;s perspective. Through the kids, we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a pillar of nobility, social conscience, and, rare for 1930&#39;s Americana, a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence, you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America&#39;s trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.Act one puts Atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. Director Robert Mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from non-professional kids. They are amusing and fun to watch. The big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small Georgia town. Who is the monstrous, &quot;6 and a half feet big&quot; legend living in the end house? Some light suspense ensues, while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. Atticus must defend an African-American man for the alleged rape of a white woman.After threats galore, an unshaken Peck takes to the courtroom jungle in, without a doubt, one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. Brock Peters lends the film its best moments as the accused &quot;negro&quot; on trial. This man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep, deep sorrow. We know Atticus is a good man, a decent human being with a soul. He sees this in his client as well, and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement, implores the jury to vote justice. An all-male, all-white jury in the 1930&#39;s were tough listeners. Peters&#39; breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic, emotionally saddening moments you&#39;ll ever see, especially in Hollywood films of the 1960&#39;s. The scene when Peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.Act three produces a tragic death, an unlikely hero, and the bringing together of a family. The filmmakers have such a passion for the material, they seem to handle it with gentleness. Racism is a hard-boiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930&#39;s as a front for the events happening in the 1960&#39;s. The film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film, an art form itself. It is important, it is enlightening, and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING: 9 of 10"
tt0093779,244. The Princess Bride,8.0,1987,466000.0,1h 38m,PG,"A boy (Fred Savage) is home sick, and to his dismay, his grandfather (Peter Falk) has come to read him a fairy tale. It&#39;s the story of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls for farmboy &quot;As you wish&quot; Westley (Cary Elwes). He goes off to make his fortune, but after news of his death, Buttercup is being married off to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). Then the princess bride gets kidnapped by three rogues (Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, André the Giant).This is possibly the best fairy tale reimagining ever. Peter Falk&#39;s feign indifference narration sets off the great adventure, and Fred Savage has just the best balance. Director Rob Reiner has put together all the fairy tale snippets and create something even better. The characters are memorable. And who could forget the fun that Wallace Shawn has choosing the poison drink. Mandy Patinkin is absolutely amazing as the swordsman seeking revenge from the six finger man. And there will never be another André the Giant."
tt1130884,245.

I viewed the film through the lens of already knowing the plot twist, which made it a whole different experience. The ending will be remembered throughout film history as one that showed just how viciously a well written script can flip an audience over. This really is a film you should see twice."

tt0061452,247. Casino Royale,5.0,1967,34000.0,2h 11m,Approved,"Casino Royale has some outstanding elements. The production design is worth a 10. There are beautiful, often provocatively dressed or relatively undressed women everywhere you look. Many of its segments are funny; it&#39;s even occasionally hilarious.The problem arose in putting all of it together. And with at least five directors and at least ten writers, it&#39;s not difficult to see why. The whole is a mess. There is little in the way of overarching plot. Most threads are just completely abandoned after awhile.The story, which is very loosely based on Ian Fleming&#39;s James Bond novel Casino Royale (published in 1953--it&#39;s the first Bond novel), is a spoof of the typical adventure featuring the infamous secret agent. The real Bond (David Niven) went into retirement when his skills were at their peak. This Bond is quite different than the Bond we know--he is almost chaste, he&#39;s a homebody, he dedicates each evening&#39;s twilight to playing Debussy on the piano, and so on. Casino Royale has it that the Bond we know from other films is a decoy.A group of older men, representing the secret agencies of the US, the UK, Russia and France, are on their way to the real Bond&#39;s home to ask for his assistance. It seems that someone has been trying to wipe out as many secret agents as they can. While they&#39;re pitching the idea of coming out of retirement to Bond, they&#39;re attacked. Bond&#39;s house is blown up, and he (implicitly) agrees to the assignment. Casino Royale is the story of the real Bond trying to get to the bottom of the sinister agent-wipeout plan. Part of carrying that out involves changing the identity of nearly every spy to James Bond--if the real Bond is to work unimpeded, he can&#39;t always be worrying about being killed by the criminal mastermind.Each director worked on a different segment in relative isolation from the rest. This went so far as having their own portions of the script written. The problem was that despite Eon Productions (the production company behind most of the Bond films) not owning the rights to Casino Royale, they had used many of the &quot;bits&quot; in other Bond films. So there wasn&#39;t much of the book left to adapt. In addition, it was felt that a serious alternative Bond film couldn&#39;t compete against the Albert R. Broccoli/Harry Saltzman-produced films. So Casino Royale producers Jerry Bresler, John Dark and Charles K. Feldman had different writer/director teams create their own, parodic Bond segments that would be loosely tied together--it was almost a filmic version of the &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot; game, in which you fold a piece of paper so that you can&#39;t see other persons&#39; work, and you have to continue the drawing on your section with only a couple visual anchors.Each segment features a different set of stars--the primary sets centering on Niven, Woody Allen, and Peter Sellers with Ursula Andress and Orson Welles. Those are all great actors, and great comedians in at least two cases. They all do a bit of their own schtick--in some cases, they demanded this. Woody does his neurotic New York Jew character, Peter Sellers rides the gray area between bumbling buffoon and suave playboy, with a couple generic Indian and Chinese impersonations thrown in for good measure, Orson Welles does his best Paul Masson Wine-pitching &quot;elder statesman&quot; demeanor, and also throws in a few of his more famous magic tricks. All of this stuff is good, but does it work as a unified film? No. And if that&#39;s not enough evidence for you, consider that the segments were further chopped up into set-pieces. There&#39;s the &quot;M&quot;, or McTarry funeral stuff, the Niven car chase stuff, the Sellers/Andress romance stuff, and so on. Each set piece ends up being largely independent--you could almost see this as a series of skits on a similar theme. These facts make Casino Royale not quite work. It&#39;s certainly no match for a legitimate Bond film, despite the similarity of location-hopping, outrageous villains, spy gadgets and so on.But, in isolation, the segments tend to be good to excellent. The stretch with Bond visiting the faux M widow is probably the funniest. It also presages the Sir Robin section of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), but bests it in a way, if only because of its extension. The madcap ending of the film is a lot of fun for its embrace of absurdism as a supreme aesthetic disposition--and it may have even influenced some later films. And the segments with the trippiest visuals, both in the climax, are a fantastic treat for any fan of surrealism. They&#39;re good enough to watch the film just to see them. The production design is incredible throughout the film. Not just for the surrealism, but the lush Edwardian and Victorian interiors, complete with copies and works in similar styles to unique, influential artists such as Gustav Klimt and Otto Dix.If we felt like being overly generous, we might be able to argue that the overarching mess of a plot was part of the point. This is a spoof of Bond, after all, and Bond novels and films tend to have sprawling plots--both geographically and narratively. We do travel to many exotic locales, meet many exotic people, doing exotic things, and we receive many plot intricacies and twists in both the typical Bond story and in Casino Royale. However, Bond films aren&#39;t quite convoluted or messy enough to deserve this kind of spoofing, so excusing the messiness of the whole to parodic intent seems an over-ambitious stretch.Casino Royale is worth seeing, particularly if you&#39;re a big Bond fan or a big fan of any of the cast, or even if you just like a lot of late 1960s/early 1970s big, madcap comedies. Just don&#39;t expect anything like a tight story."
tt0381061,248. Casino Royale,8.0,2006,717000.0,2h 24m,PG-13,"I distinctly remember the collective groan from the James Bond fan base back in the mid 2000&#39;s when the announcement came that Daniel Craig would replace Pierce Brosnan as the new James Bond. Fans were up in arms because Daniel Craig has blonde hair and baby blue eyes, instead of themore traditional darker traits that were synonymous with the James Bond character. Funny how once &#39;Casino Royale&#39; was actually released, those skeptics immediately disappeared.Daniel Craig proves he has the charm, elegance, presence, and confidence that the fans have come to expect from James Bond. He just has a very powerful aura about him from that start that easily establishes him as the next James Bond.Mads Mikkelsen plays the main antagonist Le Chiffre, who is one of my favorite James Bond villains. The film actually provides insight into his backstory to shed some light on the motivations behind his actions. Le Chiffre is humanized because the audience simply understands his reasons for being &quot;the bad guy&quot;, which makes him much more relatable and interesting as a character. This is the antithesis of traditional Bond villains that have a tendency to be very over-the-top and evil just for the sake of being evil.Eva Green plays Vesper Lynd, who is assigned to supervise James Bond during his mission. Not only is Eva Green stunningly beautiful, she also perfectly portrays the charm, wit, determination, and overall likeability of Vesper. Not much can be said without getting into spoiler territory, but I will say her story arc is one of the highlights of the movie. The women in the James Bond franchise have historically been shallow sex objects, but Vesper&#39;s character contains significantly depth than female characters in prior films.The action sequences are perfectly placed throughout the film and choreographed beautifully. However, some of the most suspenseful scenes in the film aren&#39;t even the scenes with action. The high stakes poker game itself unfolds in a way that creates enormous suspense and excitement. These scenes at the card table are so perfectly crafted, the audience is left with even greater anticipation and excitement than any action scene in the film.Every part of &#39;Casino Royale&#39; is extraordinarily well-written. The characters are interesting, relatable, and have depth. The plot is stimulating and compelling. The movie is beautifully shot. There is so much attention to detail. There are so many small moments scattered throughout the film that add massive amounts of depth to the story. There are many elements of cinematography utilized, like lighting/colors/camera angles, that perfectly complement the storytelling aspect of the film.&#39;Casino Royale&#39; is not just a good James Bond film, it&#39;s a good film altogether. It&#39;s a must-watch film for anyone, whether or not you&#39;re a fan of the James Bond franchise."

tt1302006,250. The Irishman,7.8,2019,453000.0,3h 29m,R,"I don&#39;t know where to start on this one other than thanking Netflix for being the only distributor to fund this movie so we could see Big screen legends take their last big swing. The set and screen is smaller than I liked it to be, it being released on a streaming site but it&#39;s better than never seeing it.It&#39;s not a flawless movie and I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call it a masterpiece or something new and innovative. But for an old genre gangsta flick it&#39;s easily one of the best ones out there.The plot is a lot like Godfather 2 from De Niros perspective but that&#39;s all there is. It is more grounded and far too subtle compared to Goodfellas. And that&#39;s a good thing considering the age of the lead actors in the movie. But that doesn&#39;t mean its dull, gray and dreary because it isn&#39;t. It is surprisingly humorous, has some very serious scenes and doesn&#39;t shy away from giving us a blast of nostalgia every now and then.The cinematography is quite different from the usual modern movies we are accustomed to. It doesn&#39;t have an overabundance of Wes Anderson symmetric shots or Roger Deakins like Wide angle shots. The film was shot in a very old timey way with the camera pans and edits. The editing in the movie is great and the score is fitting. Technical aspects considered it isn&#39;t innovative or something jawdropping, but that was never supposed to be the main focus of the movie.The main focus for me was absolutely the acting. And why wouldn&#39;t it be with a cast like this? Al Pacino and Robert De Niro for the 1st time on screen together since Heat. Joe Pesci and De Niro since Goodfellas. Joe Pesci coming out of retirement and Martin Scorsese directing all these legends on screen together! If this doesn&#39;t get you excited for this film then I&#39;m afraid nothing will.Speaking of acting my god do they act! Robert De Niro gives his best performance in his older age with this. Joaquin Phoenix was a top contender for best Actor Oscar and I agreed with that but after watching THE IRISHMAN everything changed. Robert De Niro basically steals his Oscar like a gangsta and gives the best performance of the year so far. Old Bobby here still giving top notch actors a run for their money and the guy is 76 years old!When was the last time you saw Al Pacino give a really good performance? Well that&#39;s exactly what he does here and it feels so good to see him find his glory days. He is his usual shouty self but shines better when he tones it down and let expressions speak.And boy have I missed Joe Pesci over the years and don&#39;t worry he&#39;s still intense as usual. And that&#39;s weird considering he is extremely toned down in this movie. If you&#39;re looking for a violent Joe Pesci like he was in Goodfellas you&#39;ll be disappointed. But if you&#39;re looking for an intimidating Pesci with a huge presence then you&#39;re in the right place.Harvey Keitel is in the movie for a very short time but he did his job fantastically. Ray Romano was a surprising standout and I can&#39;t believe how he kept up on the same plane as some of these industry legends. He doesn&#39;t really have a bigger role and basically gets lost as the film progresses but he made the most of his screentime.The film is 3hours and 30 minutes long but it never felt that long honestly. The first 2 hours went by a breeze but the 3rd hour was unapologetically slow. It felt a bit dragged on during the final hour and felt it was skipping ahead at the same time. it wasn&#39;t boring in any way but felt it could&#39;ve been handled better. The CGI de-aging is so good that after a while you get confused how old the lead actors actually are. This is the best de-aging tech I&#39;ve ever seen honestly.Despite it being slow in the latter end it still is a fantastic film. It doesn&#39;t set out to do something different, it doesn&#39;t try to set it aside from the herd. Scorsese did what he does best and made the movie he wanted to make. Its more of a last big hurrah for these living legends than something out to be a flawless masterpiece. It will most likely be the last of its kind and also the last collaboration of Scorsese with these acting legends. Considering the time we are in this might as well be the last Scorsese film, it most definitely is the last Joe Pesci appearance in a movie and the last good mobster hit with genre legends like Al Pacino and De Niro. So enjoy it while you can and savor it. Remember this movie 10 years from now and rejoice that you were alive to witness something truly fantastic. THE IRISHMAN is a farewell for most of these legends and a loveletter to the genre. It&#39;s the last of its kind and it went out in true mobster style."
