The Godfather,tt0068646,1972,R,2h 55m,9.2,2100000,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I should probably go to bed. It&#39;s late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it&#39;s so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it&#39;s not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter&#39;s wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone&#39;s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister&#39;s wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; or &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",Mario Puzo/Peter Bart/Robert Thompson,4.37,448,180,10/4/05,New American Library
Pride & Prejudice,tt0414387,2005,PG,2h 9m,7.8,352000,"Back in 1995, the definitive version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was brought out--and everyone I know who saw that one agrees with me that it is simply the best. Much of it is the acting (having Colin Firth as Darcy isn&#39;t bad) but the biggest reason to adore the made for TV version is that it&#39;s long--very, very long. This allows the story to unfold slowly and is never rushed. Unfortunately, every movie version I&#39;ve seen is just too rushed--and it&#39;s hard to shove this wonderful story into a two-hour time slot. So, no matter how good the 2005 movie is (and it&#39;s quite good), it cannot hope to equal the mini-series. It&#39;s a shame, actually, as there&#39;s so much to like about this Keira Knightly version. The music is great, the locations top-notch and the Bennett girls actually look their proper ages! For example, in the 1940 MGM version, the actual ages of the actresses was their mid-20s to almost 40! And, the Bennetts are supposed to be teenagers (there about)! My advice is go ahead and watch this 2005 film--it&#39;s really very lovely. But then do yourself a favor--find the 1995 version. You&#39;ll be thankful, believe me.",Jane Austen/Vivien Jones,4.26,392,1821,9/1/05,Penguin Books
The Notebook,tt0332280,2004,PG-13,2h 3m,7.8,654000,"My wife and I watched this movie when it was first released and enjoyed it whilst acknowledging its manipulative aspects. I do get the bad reviews. We watched it again today while in lockdown due to coronavirus. We are now in our late 70s. For us the subject of the central relationship was very close to home both in the development of the love of the central characters and in the enduring nature of that love in their twilight years. It&#39;s easy to be cynical about a movie such as this but, boy, does it pack a punch when you&#39;ve lived it.",Nicholas Sparks,4.09,214,1090603,7/5/04,Bantam
A Walk to Remember,tt0281358,2002,PG,1h 41m,7.3,227000,"This was one of the best films I&#39;ve seen lately. Mandy Moore shone in her role as Jamie Sullivan, although never to the point where she became unbelievable. Her singing was fabulous, but it was clear that this was not a film about her singing - too many pop artists starring in films wind up in films about their pop careers, whether real or inferred.The storyline was VERY good. I can&#39;t say too much without spoiling it for everyone else, but take my word for it. You absolutely must watch this film at some point - make sure you grab plenty of tissues though, because if you don&#39;t get emotional towards the end, you must have a heart of stone.All in all, fantastic.",Nicholas Sparks,4.17,240,555995,9/1/04,Grand Central Publishing
I Am Legend,tt0480249,2007,PG-13,1h 41m,7.2,849000,"If I could sum this movie up in one sentence, it would be this: Go Will. Will Smith is the driving force of I Am Legend. His performance as Dr. Robert Neville is impeccable. Living in a deserted NY city, his acting is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but instead of a volleyball, he has mannequins and a faithful German Shepard named Sam. His basement, a retro-fitted, high-tech lab to find a cure for the disease that has turned the population of the entire planet into mutant, zombie-like, hive mind, blood-thirsty monsters, and, for some reason, Robert is immune. His days, spent hunting. His nights, sleeping with a high-powered rifle and hoping that the mutants don&#39;t find him. Keeping the movie flowing are well placed flashbacks that show what happened to Robert&#39;s family and why he is there. The movie falters a bit at the end, maybe at the last 5 minutes, but it doesn&#39;t ruin the plot or acting put forth. Containing wonderful cinematography and CG, I Am Legend is a spectacular film that I will be seeing again! PS - Shout out to my NY National Guardsmen in this film! Great job!",Richard Matheson,4.07,160,55751,1/21/99,Millenium
Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,tt0396171,2006,R,2h 27m,7.5,273000,"With &quot;The Perfume&quot; it&#39;s like with any blockbuster movie: if the critics praise it, it&#39;s horrible - if the critics hate it, it&#39;s brilliant.I had the chance to watch a preview of &quot;The Perfume&quot; tonight and I was very surprised: this movie is really good! Okay, it can&#39;t actually make you smell all the scents and odours, but the images and the music allow you to experience the atmosphere and the emotions Grenouille is feeling when he takes in the scents of his environment. You couldn&#39;t have done this much better without the use of real scents at theatres.Although much of the story is told by a narrative voice (mostly quotes from the novel), the movie is still thrilling and exciting all the way. It&#39;s a very good adaption of Süskind&#39;s novel, sticking to the original plot concerning the major events, leaving away unnecessary subplots (although it&#39;s a pity that funny &quot;lethal gas&quot;-plot was cut out!) and shortening long passages. The result is well-constructed movie that is worth seeing.The actors, especially Whishaw who plays Grenouille, have done a very good job. Like in the novel, Grenouille is an ambivalent character and you never know whether to love him for his genius talent or to hate him for his cruel murders. Whishaw&#39;s half-crazy, scary gaze made me shiver. Dustin Hoffman as old and unsuccessful parfumeur Baldini was very convincing... I loved the way he talks to Grenouille arrogantly although he recognizes how much more talent the young man has. Baldini is always good for a laugh.The only thing to criticize is that the movie is not as brutal as the novel. I think they wanted to avoid the FSK 16 rating and so didn&#39;t show much violence, which in my opinion would have been necessary if you wanted the movie to have the same shocking impact on the audience as the novel. For example I was really shocked by the end of the novel - in the movie you hardly see what happens.However, it&#39;s really a thrilling story visualized excellently - go to the movies and watch &quot;The Perfume&quot;! You won&#39;t be disappointed.",Patrick Süskind/John E. Woods,4.02,255,1124,2/13/01,Vintage International
The Devil Wears Prada,tt0458352,2006,PG-13,1h 49m,6.9,499000,"We in the United States like to believe that we reside in a country without royalty and nobility. The only people who think that there is true egalitarianism have never worked in the Entertainment and Media Industries. There is an aristocratic elite, no question, and it is not exactly made up of politicians (although there are some). It is largely composed of those who control media, particularly in television, film, radio, music, fashion, and print. They control what get&#39;s seen and what doesn&#39;t. When these people put on huge events that involve the press, cameras, and limousines, the public comes out to pay unquestioned homage to these elites, often on the sideline behind a barricade. With cameras flashing, these people are treated like the royalty of the 17th and 18th centuries. &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; examines what is like to be in the inner circle of one of these elites.In addition to the public&#39;s clamoring to glimpse these powerful elites, another segment of the population desires to become one of these people by trying to &quot;break into&quot; the media business. Since there are many more people who dream of being in these circles than there are spots available, this gives enormous power to those already on the inside, particularly those who have sway to either make or break an up-and-coming career. &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; chronicles an aspiring journalist who lands a dream job that, she is told, &quot;thousands would kill for&quot;: being the personal assistant to the editor of one of the largest fashion magazines, Runway, whose editor-in-chief makes Bill Gates seem like a softy. The character, Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep in a tour-de-force Oscar-nominated performance) is in fact modeled after real-life Vogue Magazine editor Anna Wintour whose chilling detachment from those around her, her ability to make or break fashion careers, and her cut-throat demands on her staff have become legendary throughout the fashion world.In the film, the corporation that is &quot;Runway&quot; is no democracy. It is feudalism, with Mirander the absolute queen ruling over her dominion of serfs who constantly scatter about trying to please her. The central character, Andy Sachs, is plunged into this Madison Avenue purgatory without knowing the rules of the game. A journalism-major from Northwestern, Andy knows next to nothing about the fashion world, but it&#39;s not just the fashion world--it&#39;s the world of the elite in New York. Since everyone wants to gain favor from the higher-ups in order to step up the ladder, there&#39;s often over-the-top deference to those in elite positions. I half-expected her female assistants to curtsy when Mirander entered the office. Mirander knows perfectly-well her status and she uses it, often flaunts it, to her advantage. Her staff run around like castle servants anticipating the arrival of the Lady of the Manor.Streep is magnificent as her voice never reaches past mezzo-piano. When one of her staff has transgressed, or simply cannot fulfill her expectation (I doubt Superman could hold a job there), in the softest tone possible she expresses her disappointment. And yet, the anticipation of her negative reaction is what makes for moments of anti-gravitational intensity. Of course, she never compliments anyone when they&#39;ve done well. Excellent performance is taken for granted in this kingdom. I&#39;ve never found the raging tyrant frightening. Rather, it is the even-tempered soft-spoken empress with absolute power who sends anyone who to displeases her to the block with a disinterested wave of the figure that is the most terrifying.At one point in the film, Andy chuckles when Miranda fusses over some seemingly identical-looking belts which of course spawns a lecture about how Andy&#39;s current wardrobe was in fact created by the fashion elite. This does point to another side of the fashion facade which I think may be the point of the film. If you take away the cameras, the celebrities, the allure, the models posing in museums wearing the latest by Christian Dior, at the end of the day all this is about is just jackets, belts, purses, skirts, dresses, and pants. I think one of the characters says as much. These clothes may look wonderful, even stunning, but that&#39;s all they are. They are lifeless pieces of fabric cut in a certain way to make the wearer look appealing but that&#39;s all it is. The fashion industry of course needs to perpetuate the idea that clothing is much more than clothing: that beautiful fashions will create fairy-tale existences for the purchasers. They are meant to represent a life of luxury and splendor and the purchase of these articles will bring you closer to that reality. When it doesn&#39;t, you need to buy more of these clothes. And you need to read Runway (aka Vogue) to tell you what you should buy. Of course, the only ones who actually have these fairy tale existences are the ones providing the clothes. Most of the people buying these fashions are still behind the barricade. Is there an irony here?",Lauren Weisberger,3.74,432,744569,5/30/06,Anchor Books
Bridge to Terabithia,tt0398808,2007,PG,1h 36m,7.2,182000,"When I sat down to watch Bridge to Terabithia, I did not know quite what to expect. From what I had seen in the trailers, I thought the movie would be about two kids that end up in some magical world, similar to the Chronicles of Narnia (clearly, I did not read the book). Needless to say that I was surprised when actually seeing the movie. I shall not spoil the story for those who have yet to see the movie, but I will say that, in my opinion, this movie is for a more mature audience than one would think. Rather than being a fairytale for youngsters, the movie actually gives the viewer an inside look in a young boy&#39;s life and all the troubles he faces, concerning school, family and friends. The setting overall was a lot darker than expected as well. I can be short about the acting. The child-stars that play the lead roles did a great job and really brought the characters to life. On this subject I must give some credit to the director as well, as it is very difficult to work with children and to get them to play the part exactly the way you want them too. One final aspect of the movie that deserves mentioning is the fact that it does not lean on special effects. Although there is a fair amount of nice CGI present in the film, the story dominates. Which in my opinion, is a lot better than the other way around. Overall, I found the movie very enjoyable, but I would advise parents of young children to find out more about the movie, before deciding on whether or not you&#39;ll let your kids watch it.",Katherine Paterson/Donna Diamond,4.0,191,1811,7/1/08,HarperTeen
P.S. I Love You,tt0431308,2007,PG-13,2h 6m,7.0,222000,"I saw this movie on a girls-night-out to the movies, and we chose it on the basis of the previews, which had billed it as a romantic comedy. Wow, were they ever wrong! The basic plot is this: Woman loses husband far too early and tragically. Woman grieves for husband, hard. Husband, through a plan pre-arranged before his death, sends woman letters at set intervals, each one causing a fresh stream of tears to fall.The acting was great. Hillary Swank was particularly good in her role, and let us see her vulnerability and conflicting emotions. The supporting cast was all excellent, and ladies, there is more than enough male eye candy in this movie to go around.But - and I strongly warn all of you considering this as a light comedy or a date movie - it&#39;s sad. Very very sad. Even the happy parts are sad. If you go see this, wear waterproof mascara and bring lots of tissues.

My Sister's Keeper,tt1078588,2009,PG-13,1h 49m,7.3,101000,"80/100. This was so much more interesting than I was expecting. It tackles several issues and does so with finesse and without the over the top melodrama movies of this type so often have. It&#39;s touching, thought provoking and it is certainly not predictable. Nick Cassavettes deserves a lot of credit for creating a film that faces the issues without getting too maudlin and does so with sensitivity and objectiveness. The performances are good from everyone. The casting of Cameron Diaz isn&#39;t perhaps the best, but I admire the effort she put into the role. She did very well. The character development is outstanding, you get to know each character and you understand each of their perspectives. Joan Cusack is particularly affecting in an offbeat role for her. Good score, the subtle cinematography is effective.",Mavis Applewater,3.86,252,89,3/9/04,Limitless Corporation
The Da Vinci Code,tt0382625,2006,PG-13,2h 29m,6.6,472000,"I&#39;ve read the book, and the movie&#39;s not so bad. Obviously there are many things I&#39;d do different, but in the end it&#39;s 2,5 hours of good entertainment, and isn&#39;t that what the ratings are all about? Personally I think Tom Hanks wasn&#39;t passionate enough for Robert Langdon. That&#39;s why it&#39;s not a 9 for me.A lot of people are too harsh on this one. Mostly because they know the book and have very high expectations. I have to see my first book-to-film where the film is better.Also, you&#39;re not going to hell for watching this movie or reading the book. It&#39;s based on a novel, which is based on a few loose theories, but in the end all it wants to do is to entertain. And that is exactly what both the book and the movie did for me.",Dan Brown,3.84,489,1679706,3/28/06,Anchor
Angels & Demons,tt0808151,2009,PG-13,2h 18m,6.7,318000,"Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown&#39;s symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels &amp; Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter&#39;s more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it&#39;s not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter&#39;s Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets, the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou&#39;s character then having a lot more stake in the film, Zurer&#39;s scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti-matter. In the book she&#39;s the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she&#39;s neither love interest, nor his intellectual equal.Ewan McGregor on the other hand, chews up each scene he&#39;s in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there&#39;s more than meets the eye. There&#39;s no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor&#39;s performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks.The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always, and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work. While reading the book some years ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it&#39;s easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that&#39;s what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn&#39;t allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some &quot;discussion time&quot; over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it&#39;s like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.Catholic reviewers have called Angels &amp; Demons harmless, because I guess it didn&#39;t dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter&#39;s Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that&#39;s almost free.Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven&#39;t, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown&#39;s novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid. Satisfying pop-corn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular.",Dan Brown,3.89,736,2418736,4/1/06,Pocket Books
Inferno,tt3062096,2016,PG-13,2h 1m,6.2,196000,"I enjoyed the Inferno film for the most part as I&#39;m very fond of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. One of the main reasons that I like these books so much is because they provide such a wealth of background historical information so they&#39;re a prefect blend of education and entertainment.While it was obviously impractical to include an involved literary discussion of Dante&#39;s Inferno in the film, it&#39;s a shame that it was barely touched on at all as to me, it was one of the most interesting aspects of the entire story. Like many, I was also surprised and disappointed by the changed ending. The book&#39;s solution was challenging but elegant; the filmclunky and predictable. Pity.",Dante Alighieri/Ronald L.

Interview with the Vampire,tt0110148,1994,R,2h 3m,7.5,362000,"Based on the Anne Rice&#39;s novel and with a screenplay adapted by herself, this film tells the story of Lestat and Louis, two vampires with over three hundred years. Directed by Neil Jordan, has the participation of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst (as a child). It received two nominations for the Oscar (Best Art Direction, Best Original Score).This is the film adaptation of one of the greatest horror novels of this American author, and is even more appealing when we realize that she actively collaborated with the production, signing the adaptation of the script. Indeed, it&#39;s a great script, faithful to the novel and original story. And for me, this movie has another good note: fully escaping the recent &quot;sex symbol vampire&quot; cliché, fueled by movies like &quot;Twilight&quot;, this film depicts vampires as they really should be: monsters with some psychological depth.The actors are excellent in their roles. The highlight goes obviously to Pitt and Cruise, who were not only perfectly able to give charisma to the characters but also not ignore the importance of the psychological characteristics. Pitt took it to the extreme in his character, torn between the love of his own humanity and the overwhelming desire for blood he feels. The way both actors share the scene is irresistible, such as how Cruise transforms his character in &quot;evil genius&quot; of his friend.The film contains several very intense scenes with moments that can hurt some sensibilities. Nevertheless, its not a very bloody movie. The atmosphere is dark, sinister, something largely enhanced by the cinematography, dark and misty, and the soundtrack, worthy of a good horror movie (something that this film is definitely not). The special, visual and sound effects are good, such as the characterization and makeup. The costumes are exceptional, portraying accurately the clothes of the several historical periods portrayed throughout the film.",Anne Rice,3.99,342,433413,8/31/04,Ballantine Books
Jurassic Park,tt0107290,1993,PG-13,2h 7m,8.2,1100000,"This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. 
Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. 
The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (&quot;I threw up.&quot; &quot;Well that&#39;s ok! That happens sometimes&quot;-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). 
Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. 
As a classic worldwide, it&#39;s no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow.",Michael Crichton,4.02,480,451443,4/4/06,Plaza y Janes
The Green Mile,tt0120689,1999,R,3h 9m,8.6,1500000,"&quot;The Green Mile&quot; is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King&#39;s &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with &quot;The Green Mile&quot;.  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can&#39;t understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn&#39;t feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. &quot;The Green Mile&quot; will haunt you.",Stephen King,4.44,592,207869,9/1/96,Penguin Signet
A Clockwork Orange,tt0066921,1971,R,2h 16m,8.2,911000,"Few films are as sensational or infamous as Stanley Kubrick&#39;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. It&#39;s impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent &quot;reformation&quot; by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever. While the film&#39;s depictions of violence and sex are what it&#39;s most known for, ACO works on far deeper levels. The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government&#39;s attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can&#39;t be denied. Equally excellent to the film&#39;s content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick&#39;s perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick&#39;s use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist&#39;s behavior and the government&#39;s policies. A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape.

The Silence of the Lambs,tt0102926,1991,R,1h 58m,8.6,1600000,"The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn&#39;t bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it&#39;s absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal&quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he&#39;s also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster&#39;s Clarice Starling asking for Lecter&#39;s help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He&#39;s a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film&#39;s ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.Best watched with a nice Chianti...P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?",Yvonne Tasker,4.27,96,510,3/29/02,British Film Institute

The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense &quot;writing&quot;... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life.

Planet of the Apes,tt0133152,2001,PG-13,,5.7,238000,"If one wants to remake a movie, the best option is probably to choose and original that was good, but not a great classic. Clearly, any attempt to remake a concept that failed first time around is fraught with danger, but an attempt to remake a classic runs the risk that one&#39;s film will be unfavourably compared with the original. The original 1968 film of &#39;Planet of the Apes&#39; is one of cinema&#39;s great science fiction classics. More than an adventure story, it touches on some of the concerns of the late sixties- the fear of nuclear war, race relations- and also raises more fundamental issues about the relationship between man and nature, the relationship between religion and science, Darwinism and animal rights. It was therefore a brave move on Tim Burton&#39;s part to try and remake it. The main concept of Tim Burton&#39;s film is basically similar to Franklin Schaffner&#39;s. An astronaut from Earth travels to a planet ruled by intelligent apes. Humans exist on this planet, but they are regarded as an inferior species, despised and exploited by the apes. There is, however, an important difference. In the original film, the apes are the only intelligent and articulate beings on the planet. Although they have only attained a pre-industrial level of civilization (they have firearms, but no power-driven machinery, and no means of transport other than the horse or horse-drawn vehicles), they are a far more advanced species than the planet&#39;s human inhabitants, who lack the powers of speech and reason and live an animal-like existence. In Burton&#39;s remake, humans and apes have similar powers of speech and intellect; it is only the apes&#39; greater physical strength that enables them to dominate the planet and to treat the humans as slaves. It was this ironic role-reversal, with apes behaving like men and men behaving like beasts, that gave Schaffner&#39;s film its satirical power. That film was advertised with the slogan &#39;Somewhere in the Universe, there must be something better than man!&#39;, and the apes are indeed, in some respects, better than man. Their law against killing others of their kind, for example, is much more strictly observed than our commandment that &#39;Thou shalt do no murder&#39;. There is no sense that the apes are bad and the humans good. Even Dr Zaius, the orang-utan politician, is not a wicked individual; by the standards of his society he is an honourable and decent one. His weakness is that of excessive intellectual conservatism and unwillingness to accept opinions that do not fit in with his preconceived world view. (In this respect the apes are very human indeed). Burton&#39;s film takes a less subtle moral line. It is a straightforward story of a fight for freedom. The villains are most of the apes, especially the fanatical, human-hating General Thade. The heroes are Captain Davidson, the astronaut from Earth, the planet&#39;s human population who long for freedom from the domination of the apes, and a few liberal, pro-human apes, especially Ari, the daughter of an ape senator. The apes are more aggressive and more obviously animals than in the original film; they still frequently move on all fours and emit fierce shrieks whenever angry or excited. There are some things about this film that are good, especially the ape make-up which is, for the most part, more convincing than in the original film and allows the actors more scope to show emotion. (I say &#39;for the most part&#39; because Ari looks far less simian than do most of the other apes- Tim Burton obviously felt that the audience would be more likely to accept her as a sympathetic character if she looked half-human). The actors playing apes actually seem more convincing than those playing humans. Tim Roth is good as the militaristic Thade, as is Helena Bonham-Carter as Ari. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, is not an actor of the same caliber as Charlton Heston, who played the equivalent role in the original film, and Estella Warren has little to do other than look glamorous. (Heston has a cameo role as an ape in Burton&#39;s film, and even gets to repeat his famous line &#39;Damn you all to hell&#39;). Overall, however, the film is a disappointment when compared to the original, a simple science-fiction adventure story as opposed to an intelligent and philosophical look at complex issues. It tried to copy the device of a surprise ending but failed. Schaffner&#39;s famous final twist is shocking, but makes perfect sense in the context of what has gone before. Burton&#39;s makes no sense whatsoever.Tim Burton can be a director of great originality, but with &#39;Planet of the Apes&#39; he fell into the standard Hollywood trap of trying to copy what had already been done and remaking a film that never needed to be remade. It was good to see him return to form with the brilliant &#39;Big Fish&#39;, one of the best films of last year. 6/10",Pierre Boulle/Xan Fielding,3.95,192,88,6/6/00,Wings
Love in the Time of Cholera,tt0484740,2007,R,2h 19m,6.4,25000,"Quick, before the general release on Friday change the silent movie line back to &quot;My God, this is longer than sorrow&quot;. What did she mumble instead, was it &quot;interminable&quot;? Why was that wonderful line changed?I so loved the book, I cannot get an unbiased grip on the movie. My mind elaborated it favorably but with simultaneous disappointment over deviations like the &quot;sorrow&quot; line. &quot;Forever&quot; worked better in the book as the boat was ordered to return upstream. I do wish it had closed with the &quot;ripple&quot; video that is on the internet.The film touched too many threads while missing the book&#39;s soul, like trying to read Fermina&#39;s heart on her tongue. Maybe it isn&#39;t possible for a movie to do justice to any masterpiece but Florentino&#39;s long-standing relationships with the widows are as important as the &quot;body count&quot;. Young Fermina was too old, as was America. I would have cast a 15-year-old as the young Fermina and have had her reappear as America with died hair or similar artifice. I cannot forgive the script for ignoring the perversion and her suicide. I would have rather America had been entirely written out.Bardem was the perfect Florentino. Fernanda Montenegro and Hector Elizondo gave terrific performances. Marcela Mar is such a heart-throb I nearly forgive her for being twice her age. Cartagena was underplayed. The Shakira soundtrack was ideal.I&#39;ll reluctantly recommend the movie but won&#39;t shake peoples&#39; shoulders as I do when I tell them that they must read the book.",Gabriel García Márquez/Edith Grossman,3.91,348,324487,10/5/03,Vintage International
Carrie,tt0319970,2002,Not Rated,2h 12m,5.4,12000,"It seems to make as much sense to remake a great movie like Brian DePalma&#39;s 1976 horror/suspense masterpiece CARRIE for television as it did to make a sequel of it in the form of THE RAGE: CARRIE 2 three years before, but that&#39;s what has been done.  A lot of bells and whistles have been added to this television remake, but in the end this CARRIE is still in the shadow of the DePalma original.Angela Bettis (GIRL INTERRUPTED) has the unenviable task of stepping into the shoes (and the prom dress) of Sissy Spacek in the title role of a New England teen tortured at school by cruel classmates (because she doesn&#39;t belong) and at home by her religiously fanatical mother (Patricia Clarkson, in the Piper Laurie role).  Soon, she discovers she has telekinetic powers; and when the most gruesome of gags is played on her on prom night, all bets are off.Though looking much more glazed in the eyes than Spacek ever did, Bettis gives a fairly good performance as Carrie; and Clarkson&#39;s portrayal of her uprighteous mother is much more low-key, but no less threatening, than Laurie&#39;s portrayal.  The special effects, however obvious they might be, are also quite good.  But in the end, the reputation of the 1976 original, with its combination of psychological horror and teen-angst drama, still hovers over this remake.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the pig&#39;s blood scene.  It doesn&#39;t have the same jarring emotional impact this time around--not so much because we&#39;ve seen it before, but because here it looks slightly laughable when the blood gets poured onto Bettis.  Because of DePalma&#39;s use of slow-motion in the original, the blood hits Spacek like a tidal wave.I give the CARRIE remake a &#39;6&#39; just for trying.  I only regret that its shortcomings as a film have less to do with its execution as a film than the fact that the original movie still resonates much more fully.",Stephen King,3.96,253,2707,10/1/99,Pocket Books
Gone with the Wind,tt0031381,1939,G,3h 58m,8.2,346000,"I&#39;ve seen the film many times, have always enjoyed it. But I&#39;ve been reading the book for the first time. It&#39;s a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It&#39;s a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It&#39;s the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn&#39;t be introduced in the movie without extending the film&#39;s length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands.",Margaret Mitchell,4.29,1037,999139,4/1/99,Warner Books

A mixture of clown, genius and artist who has suffered personal tragedy and humiliation but one who keeps cranking amazing films. This Oliver Twist is no exception. Polanski has reworked the story and taken out the 19th century coincidences, e.g., the highly improbable fact that Oliver is Brownlow&#39;s grandson and the business with the portrait of Oliver&#39;s mother, given the old tale a fresh coat of paint with new amazing character actors such as Leanne Rowe, a young and thoroughly charming Nancy, Henry Eden, a scamp of a Dodger, Jamie Forman, a repulsive Bill Sykes with no redeeming features whatsoever and the veteran Edward Hardwicke as Brownlow. But, it&#39;s young Barney Clark who steals the show. In past versions, Oliver is merely a device upon which the other array of characters are hung.

A Beautiful Mind,tt0268978,2001,PG-13,2h 15m,8.2,1000000,"A Beautiful Mind
Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience&#39;s heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin&#39;s kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he&#39;ll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He&#39;s socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia&#39;s a tough disease, folks - it&#39;s still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says &quot;Russell Crowe&quot;, you&#39;ll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he&#39;s playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he&#39;s unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they&#39;re exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he&#39;s a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a &quot;hunk&quot; - their skills as actors aren&#39;t seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash&#39;s acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that&#39;s the essence of Crowe&#39;s performance. It&#39;s sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she&#39;s the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn&#39;t an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don&#39;t know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I&#39;ll admit it, it got me right here. But it&#39;s okay; I did that old &#39;guy-crying-in-movie-theater&#39; trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won&#39;t think you&#39;re a girly man.At any rate, it&#39;s certainly one of the best movies of the year.

The Name of the Rose,tt0091605,1986,R,2h 10m,7.7,123000,"A murder mystery set in a monastery in the late middle ages, at a time when the Franciscan order and the Holy Inquisition were at odds, mostly over the extravagances of the Papacy, is a dark and moody film, which matches the period of the story well. Once again Sean Connery takes a difficult role and makes it uniquely his. Fifteen year old Christian Slater is seen in his breakout role. But the real star of the film is the library of the monastery, a labyrinthine building that is many floors high and created with stairways that seem to always lead away from where you want to go. I found the book, frankly tedious. Umberto Eco writes in a style that is very pedantic at times, and just plain confusing at others. But the story translated well to the screen, but you must be willing to exhaust a little brain sweat to get anything out of the story.

The Mist,tt0884328,2007,R,2h 6m,7.1,358000,"If, two years ago, you told me that within a couple of years two excellent Stephen King film adaptations would be released, I would probably have laughed it off. Films like The Shining, Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Stand and 1408 are usually pretty far between (Note that I consider The Green Mile and Carrie to be the most over-rated King adaptations, so they do not appear here). I like most of the films that have been made from Stephen King novels, novellas, and short stories mainly because I like Stephen King, but I do not recommend many of them as truly good films.Frank Darabont&#39;s (writing and directing) The Mist adapts a horror novella of the same name. King&#39;s horror work has been the most difficult material to adapt, but this film is comparable to other genre stand-outs such as The Shining and 1408.A brief, dramatic thunderstorm is followed by a freak mist that descends on a small New England town. As the mist permeates the town, people congregate in the local supermarket and hardware store to stock up and gather supplies. David Drayton (Thomas Jane), his son (Nathan Gamble), and his neighbor (Andre Braugher) are among them. Tension builds as a steady stream of military vehicles pass through the mist headed south from a nearby base. But serious concern doesn&#39;t start until one of the locals runs to the supermarket with blood spatters on his clothing and talking of monsters in the mist.Indeed, there are horrors outside in the fog, but there are also horrors inside the market - as paranoia, irrationality and religion come into conflict with practical issues of survival.Unlike many horror films, The Mist examines fear and its effects realistically, looks at the horror created by forces beyond human control and the even more terrifying horror that fear creates through forces that are completely within our grasp - our own fears, our beliefs and our treatment of each other. It does so using a classic formula which is comparable to films like Night of the Living Dead and, more recently, Feast.The cinematography, editing and directing are all excellent. The acting is quite good - Marcia Gay Harden and William Sadler stood out for me - and the script is exactly where it needed to be for this adaptation.Highly recommended for King fans and horror fans.

Cold Mountain,tt0159365,2003,R,2h 34m,7.2,160000,"&#39;War movie&#39; is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.Then again, calling Cold Mountain&quot; a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts &quot;Glory&quot; director Edward Zwick shame. However, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier&#39;s tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada&#39;s cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada&#39;s rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby&#39;s deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern &quot;lawman,&quot; and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by &quot;the war of Northern aggression,&quot; mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it&#39;s hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.Make no mistake, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",Charles Frazier,3.86,356,208001,9/1/06,Grove Press

But then, once I found out there was another version of the movie I quickly rented it. But let me tell you something; This is movie is much worse than the first one, and does an awful job of telling the storyline. Although the boys were very adorable (I&#39;ll admit that)that still didn&#39;t make up for the bad acting job they did. Plus, I was really confused on why the director chose to make a nonexistent captain the most important symbol in the book. Why he did that is beyond me.

Blade Runner was a ground breaking movie, one that was way ahead of its time.Blade Runner is up there with Dune for me as one of the greatest movies to come out of the 80&#39;s, I would definitely deem it as a classic, it&#39;s so watchable.The best element for me, the visuals, this is one the truly exquisite looking film, consider the era it was made in, and the lack of sophisticated special effects and tech, this is a triumph of creativity.I know pacing is an issue for some, and storytelling has changed with time, but the pace here is very deliberate, it develops and builds, it&#39;s there to give you a sense of unease. Don&#39;t expect action at every turn, that&#39;s not the purpose of the film.The music of Vangelis is terrific throughout, it adds to the film, and never imposes or tries to overtake.I always love seeing someone&#39;s vision of the future, and the future world is wonderfully imaginative and perfectly realised, though still wonderfully 1980&#39;s, so there&#39;s plenty of punk and glam, big hair, clear plastic jackets and eye shadow galore. One thing that was spot on, a greater coming together of cultures.A recent news article about AI made me think of this film, scientists are warning about the threat posed by AI development, after watching this film again, I can see where they&#39;re coming from.Harrison Ford is great, perfectly cast as Deckard, another of his iconic roles.

The Firm,tt0106918,1993,R,2h 34m,6.9,154000,"In this excitingly convoluted genre piece by Sydney Pollack---who blossomed into a straightforwardly commercial director who was happily a part of the commercial mainstream, unlike such surviving contemporaries as Sidney Lumet and Woody Allen---Tom Cruise plays Mitch McDeere, a poor boy who is embarrassed by his meager roots now that he has graduated from Harvard Law fifth in his class. He gets offers from the top law firms in New York and Chicago, yet ultimately opts for a smaller firm stationed in Memphis. His choice is money-minded. He regards money as peace of mind, however later in the film he is less certain than he&#39;s ever been of how flush he&#39;d need to have to be truly at peace.Some movies about the law reduce the judiciary elements to the rank of incidental. This one squeezes them for all they&#39;re worth. Without betraying too much of the story, I can say that McDeere is soon enough being blackmailed by both the FBI and the firm&#39;s security chief, grizzled and mild Wilford Brimley, quite compelling in an unusual jaunt as a bad guy. To protect himself, Mitch has to exercise both mind and body, eluding hit men and outwitting lawyers, to save both his life and his license to practice law.Drawn from the novel by John Grisham, as adapted by three of the most high-priced screenwriters at the time, this star-studded suspense melodrama takes an admirable two and a half hours to work its way through a hair-splitting ethical hodgepodge. By the finale, regardless of McDeere&#39;s gasping expounding during phone calls in the middle of a chase sequence, his plan of action is bewildering. And then there is the one character who never saw two particular killers when she witnessed another character&#39;s death because she was totally enclosed and hidden, which is how she survived, but in a later scene with Mitch, she says she saw the killers and details what they looked like, even the color of one&#39;s eyes, the one actually being an albino. However, it doesn&#39;t seem as far-fetched as it would were the style of the movie not as competent even when the fine points were bleary.Sydney Pollack, usually a solid director of easy-going entertainment, liked to make big, demanding movies and he was secure working with huge stars. Whether or not that colors his movies with a sugar-coated worthiness, he utilized them as abbreviated exposition. Case in point: One glance at Hal Holbrook as the top dog of the Firm and we sense it&#39;s a suspicious organization. Holbrook almost always plays the ostensibly dignified man with skeletons in his closet. One look at Gene Hackman, as the law partner who becomes Cruise&#39;s coach, and we know he&#39;s an incredibly faulty yet essentially not such a bad man, as he always is. One look at Cruise and we get a complacent feeling, because he is, in lots of his roles, just a little slow to figure things out. His characters appear to trust people too readily, and so it seems authentic when he accepts the Firm&#39;s song and dance and inducements.The movie is practically a compilation of great small character performances. Ed Harris, menacing with a shaved head, mainly requires little more than a couple of concise appearances to persuasively disclose the FBI&#39;s case against the Firm, and to divulge its airy readiness to force a potential witness to undergo impossible duress. Another potent performance is by David Strathairn, as the brother McDeere hasn&#39;t told the Firm about. Strathairn has arisen as one of the most commanding character actors around. There are also rich performances by Gary Busey, as an articulate private eye, and especially by Holly Hunter, as his allegiant secretary. Actually, watching this high falutin&#39; legal thriller, it hit me that law firms have to some extent usurped Army platoons as Hollywood&#39;s most enjoyed universal human setting. The new law thrillers have the same components as those reliable old World War II action films: Assorted cultural and character archetypes who battle each other when they&#39;re not battling the enemy. The law movies have one formidable leg-up: the female characters engage equally in the fray, rather than simply cooking, cleaning and writing letters.The vast peanut gallery of characters makes The Firm into a persuasive Hollywood landscape. There are enough convincing people here to give McDeere a genuine environment to inhabit. And Pollack was forbearing inwith some ways with his material. He would allow a scene to go on until the point was made somewhat more acutely. That would let an actor like Hackman be stunningly compelling in scenes where he delicately authenticates that, in spite of everything, he has a decent soul. A sensitive scene near the climax between Hackman and Tripplehorn is like an advanced course in acting. The parts of The Firm seem better than the whole. And there are some great parts.",Robin Waterfield/John Grisham,4.01,76,540910,2/15/00,Addison Wesley Publishing Company

Perfectly cast in the role of Reggie Love, she brings a certain charm to a role which could have lacked in that department. And to make matters even tougher on her, she was almost outshined by Brad Renfro, who made quite an impression in a film such as this.

This is certainly wandering reminiscences, but that&#39;s another type of literature too, isn&#39;t it? Why does every story have to be going somewhere special?

The Rainmaker,tt0119978,1997,PG-13,2h 15m,7.2,86000,"A story about an aspiring young lawyer who tries to break down an insurance company, Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, a Memphis St. Law School graduate who can&#39;t seem to find a job anywhere, until he meets &quot;Bruiser&quot; Stone (Mickey Rourke). Stone is an ambulance chaser, who does whatever it takes, legal or not, to win a case. Rudy, as most law students are when they graduate, wants to take the high road, do everything by the book, and win. What he finds is that sometimes you need to get down and dirty to help your client. In this case, his client is a young boy, dying of leukemia. Seems the insurance company won&#39;t pay for a bone marrow transplant that would save his life. Rudy sets out to help the young man and his family, in what turns out to be one of the biggest cases Tennessee has ever seen. Along with his partner Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), Rudy sets out to try and prove to the world that the insurance company is nothing more than a big time scam artist. Along the way Rudy meets (and falls in love with) a young woman (Clare Danes) who gets beat up regularly by her husband. This part of the story seemed somewhat strange to me. I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was there to do. Was it to give Rudy a love interest? Was it just to give the movie another case so the entire film wasn&#39;t centered on the insurance trial? I feel it gave the movie some heart, and showed that Rudy would fight for what he believed in, both in court and in life. But I think the movie could have been done without it. I enjoyed the trial scenes and all the grunt work that went behind it (being a future lawyer myself (I hope)). And the cast was wonderful. Each person added a little more to the movie, and each gave a great performance. Danny Glover as the (2nd) judge gave a little humor to the movie, but also made you feel good about Rudy&#39;s chances in court. He was going to play fair, but hew as also going to give Rudy the benefit of the doubt. Jon Voight played the insurance company&#39;s lead lawyer, and he played his character to it&#39;s swarmy best. He is what people think lawyers are like, out only for money; win at all costs, no soul (I know attorneys like that). And he was convincing. And of course DeVito and Damon carried the film. I had my doubts about Damon playing a lawyer, but the more I watched, the more I realized that he looked like people I see at work everyday. He had the same fear in his eyes that we all do, but also that dog-eat-dog determination to prove to the world that he could do the job. The Rainmaker was more about the performances than the story.

Murder on the Orient Express,tt3402236,2017,PG-13,1h 54m,6.5,310000,"This movie was clearly made for a modern audience with no familiarity with Agatha Christie&#39;s work. Branagh&#39;s portrayal of the legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot bares only a passing resemblance to the source material with an inconsistent accent, the wrong mustache, and only some of his iconic quirks and mannerisms. That being said, it is a decent mystery that follows the plot of the story pretty well and it would probably be enjoyable to people seeing the story for the first time and having no preconceived notions of what Poirot should be.A strong supporting cast featuring Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, and many other familiar faces performs well. However, no one stands out in the way Ingrid Bergman did in the 1974 adaptation or Jessica Chastain in the 2010 version.There were also several semi-action moments that were incredibly out of character for Poirot, yet provided no actual excitement to justify the sudden stylistic change. The ending hints at Death on the Nile being the next mystery for this detective masquerading as Poirot to tackle, but Poirot should not be summoned to solve a murder, he simply stumbles upon them whenever he goes on vacation.",Agatha Christie,4.17,322,145660,8/31/04,Berkley

The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film. In every sense, a bit of a Brazillian &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, but with its own unique flavour to it.The City of God is a marvel, and a highly recommended film to watch, but not recommended for the over-sensitive or easily distressed.",Augustine of Hippo/Henry Bettenson,3.92,1186,8754,11/27/03,Penguin Books Ltd
Misery,tt0100157,1990,R,1h 47m,7.8,250000,"Misery is without a doubt one of the finest movies of the 90&#39;s and one of the best movies in the thriller genre. It is an ingeniously crafted horror masterpiece that seamlessly intertwines its incredibly tense and cleverly paced story with inventive cinematography, tight editing and exquisite performances. In my opinion Misery is one of the better adaptations of Stephen King&#39;s works and truly a movie that cannot be missed, especially for the genre fans.Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is the author of a successful series of romance novels about a character called Misery, who decides to take a more serious approach regarding his future novels. On his way to publish his new manuscript, Paul drives from his hotel in Silver Creek to New York. Due to the extreme weather conditions, he has an accident that leaves him severely injured and hopeless. A local nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) finds Paul and brings him to her remote home in order to help him recover. Claiming to be his number one fan, Annie discovers that in his last Misery novel her favorite character dies and then her obsession about him takes a dark and twisted turn as a long story of captivity and abuse begins.The direction by Rob Reiner is phenomenal and on a Hitchcockian level as the film has a plethora of perfectly crafted suspenseful moments that have the audience on the edge of their seats from the beginning till the amazing climax. The editing of the movie is also flawless, as the shots are specifically designed to induce tension in any moment they can. The cinematographer and Reiner both ace the perilous atmosphere of the picture, using close up shots of the moonfaced Wilkes both in her fits of rage and kindness which magnifies the polar extremes that Wilkes is prone to unexpectedly visit. What is also triumphed is the slow convergence of the audience and Paul Sheldon. The movie received a lot of critical acclaim, especially due to Kathy Bates&#39; chilling and memorable performance as Anny Wilkes that earned her the 1990&#39;s leading actress Oscar award, which remains the only Oscar ever given to a Stephen King film adaptation. No matter how great Kathy Bates&#39; Oscar-winning performance is, James Caan&#39;s cannot go unnoticed as it definitely qualifies as one of the best performances in his extensive career, despite how demanding and challenging his role as Paul Sheldon was.In conclusion, Misery is a dark and tense masterpiece that is an amalgamation of excellent direction, skillful writing, taut editing, amazing cinematography and stellar performances, which succeeds into creating the feeling of captivity and helplessness that the thriller genre was purposefully built for, and that makes it one of the best movies of the 90&#39;s and one absolute classic in its genre.",Stephen King,4.16,370,429510,11/1/88,New English Library
Pet Sematary,tt0098084,1989,R,1h 43m,6.5,120000,"A doctor (Dale Midkiff) and his family move to a new home, dangerously close to a busy highway. After the death of the family cat, the doctor&#39;s neighbor lets him in on a secret: there is a sacred Indian burial ground where buried pets come back to life. The obvious question is: does it work on people? Not to say this is a bad film (it&#39;s not), but the thing about this one is that its reputation and cultural impact have overshadowed the film itself. We all know that burying things in the sacred ground will bring them back to life, and that&#39;s without even having to see this film.There is much good to say about this one: an amazing talent in Gage Creed, the little boy. Some nice violence and gore (including an Achilles tendon slice). One of the most painful things I&#39;ve seen on film, when the doctor falls out of bed (I admit I winced a bit).Mike Mayo points out that this is something of a variation on &quot;The Monkey&#39;s Paw&quot;, and we agree it&#39;s a praiseworthy version. He says the film &quot;lasts 30 seconds too long&quot;, and I see his point, but cannot comment on that here. Howard Maxford is considerably more critical (as usual -- he is the most negative horror critic I know) and says it is &quot;over-extended&quot; and could have made a good half hour of television.Stephen King has made some good films and some bad ones (how much this is his fault or the fault of the directors is debatable).

People really do get killed by rabid dogs...this film just exaggerates the truth a bit. I can&#39;t say I really enjoyed this film as it is not what I look for in horror films. It&#39;s a very good film - well acted, well directed, suspenseful and emotional, but it&#39;s not really &quot;fun&quot; to watch. It starts off with the dog getting infected, and from then on tension is built up slowly as you sense the dog is getting angrier and angrier. Eventually it snaps and starts killing people. The bulk of the film focuses on when Donna and her son are trapped in the broken down car because Cujo attacks whenever they try to leave. You can feel all the desperation, pain and isolation of Donna and her son as they lay trapped inside. It makes you think twice about dogs and certainly what you would do in such a situation. Would you run, attack the dog, or wait until help arrives? This is not a fun, campy or cheesy horror film, so don&#39;t watch if you&#39;re a fan of cheese.

Red Dragon,tt0289765,2002,R,2h 4m,7.2,302000,"Red Dragon is based on the novel of the same name written by Thomas Harris and is directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally. It stars Edward Norton, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Harvey Keitel, Mary-Louise Parker &amp; Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Dante Spinotti is on cinematography and Danny Elfman scores the music.Red Dragon is a prequel to the hugely successful Silence of the Lambs. The story had already been filmed as Manhunter in 1986 directed by Michael Mann. The signs weren&#39;t particularly good for Red Dragon. The previous year had seen Ridley Scott tackle Silence Of The Lambs follow up, Hannibal, with tepid results. While at the helm here was the director of such fodder as Rush Hour 1&amp;2, and of course Mann&#39;s take on the story is viewed as a grainy and skin itching cult classic. Nice to report then that even tho it&#39;s hardly in the same class as &quot;Lambs,&quot; it&#39;s a willing entertainer that genuinely manages to unease.Firstly one has to get past the Hannibal Lecter factor to fully enjoy (and dampen expectations) the movie on its own terms. Lecter (Hopkins enjoying himself but going thru the motions) is a secondary character. Important? Yes! But still secondary to Norton&#39;s troubled but gifted FBI agent Will Graham and Fiennes bonkers serial killer Francis Dolarhyde (AKA:The Tooth Fairy). Red Dragon is first and foremost a ripping good old detective story, with Ratner and Tally wisely using the bits that made Harris&#39; novel such a page turning success. They have added their own bits of course {the pre-credit sequence involving Lecter &amp; Graham sets things up perfectly}, but ultimately it&#39;s a loyal enough telling of a gripping and goose flesh inducing story.The makers have wisely filled the film out with quality performers. Norton underplays Graham nicely, a character unable to stay away from the job that threatens his family, he becomes an easy guy to root for as things start to get troubling. Fiennes too doesn&#39;t go over the top, in great physical shape and with piercing blue eyes, he exudes menace without resorting to being a cackling caricature. Hoffman was a shoe in for a weasel reporter since he does it so well, while Keitel, tho not having to stretch himself, offers up a stoic turn as Jack Crawford. But the main performance, and sadly unheralded, comes from Emily Watson as the blind Reba. With Reba acting as both a romantic and redemptive foil to Dolarhyde&#39;s split-personality, Watson gets the tough gig, and comes up trumps with an affecting turn featuring the right amounts of spunk, sadness and needy tenderness.It&#39;s a bit too polished to be a nerve shredder, with Ratner unable to give the film an atmospheric feel befitting the darkness at its core. But it does deliver on the promise of not only that opening segment, but also on Harris&#39; fine procedural narrative. 7/10",Thomas  Harris,4.04,348,236028,5/22/00,Dutton
Hannibal,tt0212985,2001,R,2h 11m,6.8,304000,"For the most part, I enjoyed this film. I was engaged throughout and that&#39;s what you want from a film. However, I found myself frustrated with some of the nonsensical choices of the characters. Hopkins was as brilliant as ever. This Hannibal was a lot more ruthless but just as cunning, perceptive and observant. I really like Julian Moore as an actress but I&#39;m just not sure she was right for this role as a shoe-in for the character of Clarice. I don&#39;t know if it was because I was comparing her to Jodie Foster&#39;s Clarice, but it just felt like two completely different characters. She wasn&#39;t as intellectual, sharp or astute as the original Clarice. She felt a lot more vulnerable than the original Clarice. And she made some questionable decisions throughout the film to say the least. Lastly, WHAT happened to the southern twang in her accent, yes your accent can change over the ten years that passed but there wasn&#39;t even a trace of it!This film overall was an interesting, further insight into Hannibal&#39;s character and also the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice, and his matured fondness for her.

Perhaps Alphonso Curon would have done a better job of cohesion but there really isn&#39;t much more that could have been done in the time and the script would have been essentially the same.

Here we get introduced to new characters, the standout being Kenneth Branagh, a Shakespeare veteran, who stole every scene as Gildaroy Lockhart. I loved it when he said &quot;It&#39;s filthy down here,&quot; the whole cinema were in hysterics at that. Jason Isaacs was menacing too, and Dobby was hilarious with his constant head-banging. Daniel Radcliffe is audibly older here and it does work at its advantage. I thought 23 year old Christian Coulson as Riddle was very good indeed, though Riddle was much scarier in the book. Other scenes of comic relief were provided by Ron&#39;s parents, played respectably by Julie Walters and Mark Williams. However, there were still some frightening scenes, and the plot at times seemed to be convoluted. Richard Harris was surprisingly good, considering he was ailing quite visibly, and some months later he sadly died.

Twilight,tt1099212,2008,PG-13,2h 2m,5.3,506000,"That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would&#39;ve just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I&#39;m not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson&#39;s baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it&#39;s kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn&#39;t expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn&#39;t aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he&#39;s immortal. But he doesn&#39;t have fangs, and he doesn&#39;t drink human blood.So, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it&#39;s average, it&#39;s my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I&#39;m a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn&#39;t take their &quot;love&quot; seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward&#39;s father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you&#39;re a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matinée price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.5/10",Stephenie Meyer,3.59,501,4597666,9/6/06,Little  Brown and Company
Into the Wild,tt0758758,2007,R,2h 28m,8.0,679000,"Sean Penn&#39;s new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless&#39;s parents, because he doesn&#39;t want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.Emile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minuteswith Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no licenseand it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.Hirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn&#39;t that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I&#39;m even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God.",Jon Krakauer,3.98,207,800349,1/20/97,Anchor Books

Marcus did the song &quot; killing me softly &quot; because it was one of his mums favorites and even though the audience was banal and cruel he still had the gumption and heart to get up there an perform for his mom. life isn&#39;t about trying to fit in and be with the cool crowd, there&#39;s so much more important things in life then that and Marcus was mature enough to understand that, with help from Will of course. well, i won&#39;t give anything else away about this movie, but if you&#39;re looking for a intelligent, heartwarming, tender, sad and funny movie, this is it. i would recommend this movie to just about anybody over the age of 10. this is one of those hidden little gems that has also a very strong positive message about what is right and what is wrong. there was not one dull moment in this movie and i think i must&#39;ve chuckle or guffawed about 50 times during the duration of this movie and it&#39;s not a long movie.if you like intelligent tender heartwarming comedic movies where all the actors and actresses were in top form...then you have to watch this movie. one of my favorite comedies all-time.",Nick Hornby,3.8,278,825,4/4/02,Penguin

My rant is it is their responsibility to do a little homework about a movie -- don&#39;t just go because it&#39;s free! That said...what a beautiful film. The visuals are something you will remember, the acting is superb, the cast (the kids as the young students and the older kids), the horror of &quot;the secret&quot; and then the unveiling of the reason for &quot;hope&quot; they cling to. One of the best reasons to see this movie is that you will need to think about topics you have not ever grappled with before.

That was a film that used history to tell a story about real people who had a love to change a nation. In this version of the eponymous Phillipa Gregory novel, historical inaccuracies abound. Approximately fifteen years are compressed into two hours with no indication time has gone by except for various babies. None of the characters ever change or grow any older. The characters in this movie are completely one-sided. Anne is ambitious. Henry is a womanizer. Mary is simple. No one has any complexities. The sisterly rivalry plays out like an underdeveloped soap opera. On the other hand, the film is engaging and the costumes lovely. Same with the gorgeous palace settings. Eye candy it is.

Madame Bovary,tt2334733,2014,R,1h 58m,5.7,9100,"First, the short summary at the top of the IMDb page COMPLETELY MISREPRESENTS the plot of the movie and novel. Madame Bovary is not simply cheating on her husband to advance her social status.Her affairs are part of a much more profound struggle for transcendence from the ordinary life in which she feels trapped. That&#39;s why the novel is a classic of modern literature. The way IMDb puts it makes it sound like a cheap Lifetime movie.Second, Mia Wasikowska is a fine actress but I&#39;ve always imagined Madame Bovary as a much more sensual woman.Third, I think Ezra Miller was terribly miscast as Leon Dupuis. Not to disparage his acting, but he&#39;s far too young and effeminate to be an object of desire for Emma Bovary.While the film was beautifully shot, it otherwise doesn&#39;t quite do justice to Flaubert.

Macbeth,tt2884018,2015,R,1h 53m,6.6,61000,"Was actually really looking forward to seeing this 2015 film version of &#39;Macbeth&#39;. The play is one of Shakespeare&#39;s best, most famous and most quotable and has leant itself to film, with Roman Polanski, Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa all giving it splendid treatment. The cast is a talented one, having often admired Michael Fassbender, Marion Cottilard and David Thewlis and ever since seeing him in &#39;The Borgias&#39; Sean Harris struck me as one to watch.Not to mention the great reviews. Was a little worried though too, seeing that it was directed by Justin Kurzel who directed the big misfire and huge waste of potential that was &#39;Assassins Creed&#39;. Luckily, this &#39;Macbeth&#39; lived up to expectations on the whole if not exceeding them. It is not the definitive version of the play, either on film or filmed production, and did have room for improvement, but for all its flaws the film on the whole surprisingly impressed me.This &#39;Macbeth&#39; isn&#39;t perfect. It is agreed not always easy to understand the dialogue, which didn&#39;t need to be as hushed or as muttered. While the film a vast majority of the time looked absolutely great, there is a gratuitous overuse of slow-motion.Especially in the first 10 minutes or so, which were more sluggish than arresting. There are cuts and some of the omissions do affect the drama where the storytelling becomes less coherent.For all those drawbacks, there are a lot of positives with this &#39;Macbeth&#39;. Other than the slow motion, it is quite an amazing looking film, with hugely atmospheric and grandiose visuals (from the suitably myterious fog early on right up to the boldly bloodthirsty climax). The photography to me was some of the best of that year, especially in the act and those locations are hugely effective in their atmosphere, uncompromising but also oddly beautiful and dark without taking it to extremes. The music is still haunting and Kurzel&#39;s direction is bolder and less muddled than it was in &#39;Assassins Creed&#39; from the following year.Moreover, although it would have been nice if it was more consistently intelligible, Shakespeare&#39;s text is still powerful and hard to forget. The story takes time to get going but does get more compelling and remarkably ambitious, at its most emotionally investable from the point where Macduff learning of his family&#39;s murder (which has always been a very moving part of the plot) up to the end. The action is both exciting and ferociously harrowing, pulling no punches without being too unnecessarily over the top (seeing as &#39;Macbeth&#39; is already a dramatically brutal play).Some interesting changes here. Really did like that the witches weren&#39;t portrayed in a way that was too reliant on witch cliches, and were spooky underneath their deceptive exteriors. Lady Macbeth is still an effective and steely manipulator but it was interesting to see a more conflicted side to her (very different as it is not what the play indicates) rather than her being completely villainous. This is not going to work for some, but to me it was interesting. The performances were on the whole great from all, Fassbender is searingly fierce in the title role without being too brutish and Cotillard contrasts with him effectively as a steely and imperious Lady Macbeth. Paddy Considine&#39;s Banquo is suitably noble and Harris proved in &#39;The Borgias&#39; that he could do creepy but also tortured, and he is very moving here as Macduff. It is somewhat sad that Duncan&#39;s role in the play is not bigger because Thewlis, while perhaps a touch young, commands the part extremely well.In conclusion, intriguing and well done but there are better versions of &#39;Macbeth&#39; around. 7/10",William Shakespeare,3.9,249,592315,7/1/13,Simon  Schuster
Death on the Nile,tt0077413,1978,PG,2h 20m,7.3,42000,"This movie was the first and best of Peter Ustinov&#39;s performances as Hercule Poirot.  Though physically not very accurate to Agatha Christie&#39;s description of the little Belgian detective, for this one movie everything worked and the discrepancy was not a problem.  The film is well-paced, with all the plot turns and clues coming with perfect timing, not too fast to be confusing, but not too slow to strain the rather flimsy fabric of the story. The whole cast is very good, especially Bette Davis as a malevolent old spider of a woman, gleefully tormenting her long-suffering companion, Maggie Smith. The scene where she smiles indulgently at a group of Egyptian children waving at her on the river bank, only to sink into mortified disgust as they turn around and moon her, is a highlight of the movie.  The climax of the film is quite surprising, and unlike many mysteries, does not cheat the viewer by withholding vital information until the last moment.  We feel the pleasure of being honestly fooled throughout, and the conclusion is thoroughly satisfying.",Agatha Christie,4.1,351,674,3/30/07,Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers
Evil Under the Sun,tt0083908,1982,PG,1h 57m,7.0,22000,"Peter Ustinov recreates the role of Poirot, following the wonderful Death On The Nile.   This is not the story as Agatha Christie wrote it, but here we have a rare example of the movie being better than the book.  In fact it would be more accurate to say that here we have a murder mystery based on an idea by Miss Christie.  We are presented with is a cast of characters, a murder victim, and just about everyone has a motive. Poirot of course, deduces who did it.  The sun in question, under which this evil takes place, shines down on a privately owned island in the Mediterranean, giving us a warm and exotic location.There isn&#39;t one bad performance among the cast, several of whom have appeared before in at least one other Poirot story.  Maggie Smith and Jane Birkin in Evil Under The Sun;  Dennis Quilley and Colin Blakely in Murder On The Orient Express.   Diana Rigg and Maggie Smith almost steal the show as two women who smile sweetly at each other as they spit venom!  But every bit as good are Blakely, Quilley, Mason, McDowall and the rest.  And while all this is going on, the soundtrack is solid gold Cole Porter, which has been orchestrated perfectly to fit the story.This movie is pure fun.

Dead Man's Folly,tt0090914,1986,Not Rated,1h 30m,6.3,2400,"I haven&#39;t read the book Dead Man&#39;s Folly, and this TV movie is the only one of the 6 movies Peter Ustinov did as Poirot, where that is the case. Now Dead Man&#39;s Folly I found to be very entertaining, with very good performances and a fine denouncement. However the script was weak and underdeveloped in places, the music didn&#39;t really stand out unlike Death On the Nile(the music was absolutely superb in that movie) and I found the overall film to be a tad too broad. I don&#39;t think it is as good as Death on the Nile or Evil Under the Sun, which are the best of the Ustinov outings. On a positive note, for a TV movie, it looks beautiful, with wonderful period detail, pleasant scenery and very nice photography. And the clothes were lovely to look at too. The denouncement is very unexpected and cleverly done, and I wouldn&#39;t have guessed it in a million years. But what makes the film so enjoyable is the cast. While I still consider David Suchet to be the definitive Poirot, Peter Ustinov was still a joy to behold and is clearly enjoying himself. Jean Stapleton positively brings life to the proceedings as Ariadne Oliver. Both Kenneth Cranham and Tim Piggott-Smith give good performances, if playing it safe. Jonathan Cecil is very entertaining as Hastings and Nicollette Sheridan is lovely as Hattie. But other than Ustinov the standout was indeed Constance Cummings as Amy, a truly delightful performance. All in all, while not the best of the Ustinov Poirot outings, it is a glossy and entertaining one, and actually one of the better ones. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",Agatha Christie/David Suchet,3.79,6,12256,9/8/06,BBC Audiobooks
And Then There Were None,tt0037515,1945,Approved,1h 37m,7.4,18000,"This is a dramatization of the consummate Agatha Christie book, the benchmark for the whodunit.  Each of the characters is nicely portrayed by accomplished actors.  The pacing, the subdued dialogue, all make this film work, even though it was felt necessary to doctor the plot and rename characters (this I will never understand).  I won&#39;t criticize because I&#39;ve never felt that we should compare movies to books--they are different media--unless the plot is badly compromised.  This one is not.  I remember being really pleased as a young viewer that Christie is able to bring all issues to a resolution in a believable and realistic way--no hidden doors--no strange interventions.  She is able to do this even in her lesser books.  Sometimes it is preferable to not be open ended, leaving unfinished details.  I relish this author and the movies and movie portrayals of her books.I also need to mention the music.  The score is so carefully tuned to the actions of the characters.  The black and white photography lends itself well to the oppressiveness of the setting where the characters find themselves.  You definitely should see this film.",Agatha Christie,4.26,264,625767,5/3/04,St. Martin's Press
The Sicilian,tt0093966,1987,R,1h 55m,5.4,5700,"For entertainment value, Cimino&#39;s &#39;The Sicilian&#39; does not deliver in the Hollywood sense. That&#39;s good in my opinion.It viewed some where between documentary and romantic fairy tale. Maybe to many, the latter choice would be more appropriate. I&#39;d place Sicilian, Salvatore Giuliano or Lambert&#39;s portrayal smack in the middle. That&#39;s because even after doing much research I&#39;m still not sure who the real character was. Probably, no one really knows for sure.The plot moves along fine except for the opening flashback from Turturro&#39;s cell. Cimino should have axed the scene first cut. The inclusion of the American governess did not help the story line either. In fact, she, the actress gave an unconvincing and unflattering portrayal of Americans (the rich ones) living abroad. At times she swore like a trooper. Most of the film she sounded and looked like a hooker in communist garb, designer that is. I was so glad when she fell off the reel.The rest of supporting cast was complementary. Giuliano&#39;s accomplices were good enough and just bad enough to add intrigue. Even the crotchety old professor was a good fit as interlocutor between Giuliano, his loyal band of unhappy bandits, the fickle mob and the stripe changing church.The film&#39;s one weakness is the behind the scene&#39;s love affair between the Mafia Don and Giuliano. I found it confusing. Do competing mobsters profess such unrequited love? Perhaps they do in Sicily.If you&#39;re looking for something in the genre of the non-stop murderous mobster films, then give this one a miss. However, if you are fascinated with Sicily and their mysterious culture, &#39;The Sicilian&#39; will give you some good glimpses of the stunning mountain terrain, cosmopolitan Palermo and its people both big and small, good and bad.",Mario Puzo,3.97,416,16557,5/1/01,Ballantine Books
Patriot Games,tt0105112,1992,R,1h 57m,6.8,125000,"If I were to make a quick summary of this movie, it would be &quot;a good, but not great, action flick.&quot;  I don&#39;t think this movie was intended to be innovative, to be great, to be memorable.  What it was intended to be was entertaining, and it lived up to this expectation.Harrison Ford is the master of remaining as low-key as possible.  He has had so many films where he can over-emphasize, over-dramatize, and simply over-act.  Ford has the maturity to keep this from happening, and he does so again in this film.  Ford is supported quite well with such actors/actresses as James Earl Jones (reprising his role as Greer from The Hunt for Red October), Samuel L. Jackson, and Anne Archer.  For an action flick, acting is much above average.It was also suspenseful...thrilling.  I thought the ending had a nice build-up and climax.  I realize this is different from the book&#39;s ending...but remember, these are two different visions...not the same one. This brings up a big point in movie-watching:  Comparing a movie to a book is the worst thing you can do.  They are two completely different genres. More importantly, as I said before, they are two different visions.I&#39;m not a big action fan.  I used to be, but anymore most stories are the same.  To this end I would say Patriot Games is fairly mainstream. However, it was always fun to watch and sometimes thrilling to watch.  I&#39;m also not a big Tom Clancy fan, but I&#39;ve given the movies based off his books a shot because again they are different visions.  The result is (at least with Patriot Games) a good film to watch on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn.

Also in the cast is Sharon Lawrence as the Lieutenant&#39;s lovely wife; John Heard as the platoon member &quot;blowing the whistle&quot; and Johnson&#39;s son Jesse plays the young Lieutenant in Vietnam.

The Handmaid's Tale,tt0099731,1990,R,1h 48m,6.0,12000,"This is a nightmare vision of the future. It seems 1 out of every 100 women is fertile (for some reason). The ones who aren&#39;t perform slave labor. The ones that are are &quot;sold&quot; off to rich families where they have sex with the husband to produce a baby. Kate (the late and missed Natasha Richardson) is one such servant to Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway) and her husband the Commander (Robert Duvall). Kate wants out--but it seems there&#39;s no way.The synopsis only scratches the surface of a VERY dark and disturbing movie. It slowly shows how women are treated and used and it just gets more horrifying as it unfolds. The parallels to Hitler&#39;s Nazi Germany are fairly obvious but here we have barren women instead of Jews and gays. The good acting by everybody makes this hard to shake off. Aidan Quinn (as Nick) and Duvall are OK; Victoria Tennant is chilling as a leader of the camps; Elizabeth McGovern is just great as a fellow prisoner who befriends Kate; Dunaway is also very good in her role. Best of all is Richardson. This couldn&#39;t have been an easy role but she pulls it off beautifully. She died at far too young an age. This is basically an unknown movie and it&#39;s easy to see why--it&#39;s far too dark and disturbing for a general audience. However the ending is (sort of) uplifting (and changed from the book). Grim, dark and depressing. View it at your own risk.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,tt0073486,1975,R,2h 13m,8.7,1100000,"I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the &#39;top five&#39; Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as &quot;one of Jack Nicholson&#39;s finest roles&quot; and &quot;one of the classics of the 70&#39;s&quot;. Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy&#39;s intention, as he believes the conditions in a &quot;crazy house&quot; will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it&#39;s desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in &#39;Chinatown&#39; or &#39;As Good as it Gets&#39;. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can&#39;t help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest which hasn&#39;t already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it&#39;s glorious entirety. It&#39;s hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-10/10",Ken Kesey,4.2,272,1120,2/1/63,Signet
To Kill a Mockingbird,tt0056592,1962,Approved,2h 9m,8.3,343000,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children&#39;s perspective. Through the kids, we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a pillar of nobility, social conscience, and, rare for 1930&#39;s Americana, a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence, you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America&#39;s trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.Act one puts Atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. Director Robert Mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from non-professional kids. They are amusing and fun to watch. The big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small Georgia town. Who is the monstrous, &quot;6 and a half feet big&quot; legend living in the end house? Some light suspense ensues, while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. Atticus must defend an African-American man for the alleged rape of a white woman.After threats galore, an unshaken Peck takes to the courtroom jungle in, without a doubt, one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. Brock Peters lends the film its best moments as the accused &quot;negro&quot; on trial. This man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep, deep sorrow. We know Atticus is a good man, a decent human being with a soul. He sees this in his client as well, and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement, implores the jury to vote justice. An all-male, all-white jury in the 1930&#39;s were tough listeners. Peters&#39; breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic, emotionally saddening moments you&#39;ll ever see, especially in Hollywood films of the 1960&#39;s. The scene when Peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.Act three produces a tragic death, an unlikely hero, and the bringing together of a family. The filmmakers have such a passion for the material, they seem to handle it with gentleness. Racism is a hard-boiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930&#39;s as a front for the events happening in the 1960&#39;s. The film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film, an art form itself. It is important, it is enlightening, and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING: 9 of 10",Harper Lee,4.27,323,10524,7/5/05,Harper Perennial Modern Classics
The Princess Bride,tt0093779,1987,PG,1h 38m,8.0,466000,"A boy (Fred Savage) is home sick, and to his dismay, his grandfather (Peter Falk) has come to read him a fairy tale. It&#39;s the story of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls for farmboy &quot;As you wish&quot; Westley (Cary Elwes). He goes off to make his fortune, but after news of his death, Buttercup is being married off to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). Then the princess bride gets kidnapped by three rogues (Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, André the Giant).This is possibly the best fairy tale reimagining ever. Peter Falk&#39;s feign indifference narration sets off the great adventure, and Fred Savage has just the best balance. Director Rob Reiner has put together all the fairy tale snippets and create something even better. The characters are memorable. And who could forget the fun that Wallace Shawn has choosing the poison drink. Mandy Patinkin is absolutely amazing as the swordsman seeking revenge from the six finger man. And there will never be another André the Giant.",William Goldman,4.26,456,703676,7/15/03,Ballantine Books

I viewed the film through the lens of already knowing the plot twist, which made it a whole different experience. The ending will be remembered throughout film history as one that showed just how viciously a well written script can flip an audience over.

Stand by Me,tt0092005,1986,R,1h 29m,8.1,464000,"If you grew up in the world before WiFi, a higher fidelity world depending on your circumstances as a child, there&#39;s a good chance that a lot of your growing up was done outside, with a group of pals, mates, friends or chums - who all sought to share what they knew, and discover together what they did not.There&#39;s no coming of age so to speak, as we continually discover as we get older, but whatever it is that we do become, we generally do it without the bonds and support that were so crucial during our formative days and quite often end up aimlessly drifting, nostalgic for the past and the shared experience of growing up, with those we would have entrusted our lives, our souls, our hearts and our minds to - albeit with the occasional minor squabble thrown in for good measure.If I&#39;m ringing some bells then this film is definitely for you.",Raynold Gideon,4.32,96,1436,6/1/86,Columbia Pictures Pubns
Casino Royale,tt0061452,1967,Approved,2h 11m,5.0,34000,"Casino Royale has some outstanding elements. The production design is worth a 10. There are beautiful, often provocatively dressed or relatively undressed women everywhere you look. Many of its segments are funny; it&#39;s even occasionally hilarious.The problem arose in putting all of it together. And with at least five directors and at least ten writers, it&#39;s not difficult to see why. The whole is a mess. There is little in the way of overarching plot. Most threads are just completely abandoned after awhile.The story, which is very loosely based on Ian Fleming&#39;s James Bond novel Casino Royale (published in 1953--it&#39;s the first Bond novel), is a spoof of the typical adventure featuring the infamous secret agent. The real Bond (David Niven) went into retirement when his skills were at their peak. This Bond is quite different than the Bond we know--he is almost chaste, he&#39;s a homebody, he dedicates each evening&#39;s twilight to playing Debussy on the piano, and so on. Casino Royale has it that the Bond we know from other films is a decoy.A group of older men, representing the secret agencies of the US, the UK, Russia and France, are on their way to the real Bond&#39;s home to ask for his assistance. It seems that someone has been trying to wipe out as many secret agents as they can. While they&#39;re pitching the idea of coming out of retirement to Bond, they&#39;re attacked. Bond&#39;s house is blown up, and he (implicitly) agrees to the assignment. Casino Royale is the story of the real Bond trying to get to the bottom of the sinister agent-wipeout plan. Part of carrying that out involves changing the identity of nearly every spy to James Bond--if the real Bond is to work unimpeded, he can&#39;t always be worrying about being killed by the criminal mastermind.Each director worked on a different segment in relative isolation from the rest. This went so far as having their own portions of the script written. The problem was that despite Eon Productions (the production company behind most of the Bond films) not owning the rights to Casino Royale, they had used many of the &quot;bits&quot; in other Bond films. So there wasn&#39;t much of the book left to adapt. In addition, it was felt that a serious alternative Bond film couldn&#39;t compete against the Albert R. Broccoli/Harry Saltzman-produced films. So Casino Royale producers Jerry Bresler, John Dark and Charles K. Feldman had different writer/director teams create their own, parodic Bond segments that would be loosely tied together--it was almost a filmic version of the &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot; game, in which you fold a piece of paper so that you can&#39;t see other persons&#39; work, and you have to continue the drawing on your section with only a couple visual anchors.Each segment features a different set of stars--the primary sets centering on Niven, Woody Allen, and Peter Sellers with Ursula Andress and Orson Welles. Those are all great actors, and great comedians in at least two cases. They all do a bit of their own schtick--in some cases, they demanded this. Woody does his neurotic New York Jew character, Peter Sellers rides the gray area between bumbling buffoon and suave playboy, with a couple generic Indian and Chinese impersonations thrown in for good measure, Orson Welles does his best Paul Masson Wine-pitching &quot;elder statesman&quot; demeanor, and also throws in a few of his more famous magic tricks. All of this stuff is good, but does it work as a unified film? No. And if that&#39;s not enough evidence for you, consider that the segments were further chopped up into set-pieces. There&#39;s the &quot;M&quot;, or McTarry funeral stuff, the Niven car chase stuff, the Sellers/Andress romance stuff, and so on. Each set piece ends up being largely independent--you could almost see this as a series of skits on a similar theme. These facts make Casino Royale not quite work. It&#39;s certainly no match for a legitimate Bond film, despite the similarity of location-hopping, outrageous villains, spy gadgets and so on.But, in isolation, the segments tend to be good to excellent. The stretch with Bond visiting the faux M widow is probably the funniest. It also presages the Sir Robin section of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), but bests it in a way, if only because of its extension. The madcap ending of the film is a lot of fun for its embrace of absurdism as a supreme aesthetic disposition--and it may have even influenced some later films. And the segments with the trippiest visuals, both in the climax, are a fantastic treat for any fan of surrealism. They&#39;re good enough to watch the film just to see them. The production design is incredible throughout the film. Not just for the surrealism, but the lush Edwardian and Victorian interiors, complete with copies and works in similar styles to unique, influential artists such as Gustav Klimt and Otto Dix.If we felt like being overly generous, we might be able to argue that the overarching mess of a plot was part of the point. This is a spoof of Bond, after all, and Bond novels and films tend to have sprawling plots--both geographically and narratively. We do travel to many exotic locales, meet many exotic people, doing exotic things, and we receive many plot intricacies and twists in both the typical Bond story and in Casino Royale. However, Bond films aren&#39;t quite convoluted or messy enough to deserve this kind of spoofing, so excusing the messiness of the whole to parodic intent seems an over-ambitious stretch.Casino Royale is worth seeing, particularly if you&#39;re a big Bond fan or a big fan of any of the cast, or even if you just like a lot of late 1960s/early 1970s big, madcap comedies. Just don&#39;t expect anything like a tight story.",Ian Fleming,3.73,181,48961,8/27/02,Penguin
